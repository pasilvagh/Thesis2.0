The first challenge is to overcome the narrowness of scope of present practice in IS and EA, and re-gain the coverage of the entire business on all levels of management, and a holistic and systemic coverage of the enterprise as an economic entity in its social and ecological environment. The second challenge is how to face the problems caused by complexity that limit the controllability and manageability of the enterprise as a system. The third challenge is connected with the complexity problem, and describes fundamental issues of sustainability and viability. Following from the third, the fourth challenge is to identify modes of survival for systems, and dynamic system architectures that evolve and are resilient to changes of the environment in which they live. The state of the art section provides pointers to possible radical changes to models, methodologies, theories and tools in EIS design and implementation, with the potential to solve these grand challenges. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, it remains difficult for users to dynamically discover and instantly make use of the data provided by the plethora of REST APIs in existence across various cloud providers today. This paper presents a reference architecture built on the idea of a scalable NoSQL database that allows multiple subscribers to receive instant notifications of database changes through the use of a ""livequery"". By keeping one WebSocket connection open between each client web browser and an Object Synchronization Server, this paper shows how data from multiple disparate REST APIs can be organized and transmitted to interested clients via the database.

Mathematical models spanning fromthemolecular level through to whole populations of individuals must be integrated, then personalized. This requires interoperability with multiple disparate and geographically separated data sources, and myriad computational software tools. Extracting and producing knowledge fromsuch sources, evenwhen the databases and software are readily available, is a challenging task. Despite the difficulties, researchers must frequently perform these tasks so that available knowledge can be continually integrated into the commonframework required to realize theHumanPhysiome. Software and infrastructures that support the communities that generate these, together with their underlying standards to format, describe and interlink the corresponding data and computer models, are pivotal to the Human Physiome being realized. They provide the foundations for integrating, exchanging and re-using data andmodels efficiently, and correctly,while also supporting the dissemination of growing knowledge in these forms. In this paper, we explore the standards, software tooling, repositories and infrastructures that support this work, and detail what makes them vital to realizing the Human Physiome. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Bootstrapping is a procedure by which a user obtains key material and configuration information, among other parameters, to operate as an authenticated party in a security domain. Until now solutions have focused on re-using security protocols that were not developed for IoT constraints. For this reason, in this work we propose a design and implementation of a lightweight bootstrapping service for IoT networks that leverages one of the application protocols used in IoT : Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Additionally, in order to provide flexibility, scalability, support for large scale deployment, accountability and identity federation, our design uses technologies such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) and Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA). We have named this service CoAP-EAP. First, we review the state of the art in the field of bootstrapping and specifically for IoT. Second, we detail the bootstrapping service: the architecture with entities and interfaces and the flow operation. Third, we obtain performance measurements of CoAP-EAP (bootstrapping time, memory footprint, message processing time, message length and energy consumption) and compare them with PANATIKI. The most significant and constrained representative of the bootstrapping solutions related with CoAP-EAP. As we will show, our solution provides significant improvements, mainly due to an important reduction of the message length. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","AAA; Bootstrapping; CoAP; EAP; IoT; Lightweight","Authentication; Energy utilization; Industrial research; Internet; Internet protocols; Network protocols; Network security; Authentication authorization and accountings; Bootstrapping; CoAP; Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP); Design and implementations; Extensible authentication protocols; Lightweight; Performance measurements; Internet of things",,,,,,"Gubbi, J., Buyya, R., Marusic, S., Palaniswami, M., Internet of Things (IoT): A Vision, Architectural Elements, and Future Directions (2013) Futuregener.

Web browsers contact a server to retrieve content which is displayed to the user. With this approach the server responds to all requests which can result in a performance bottleneck. Peer-to-peer systems allow clients to retrieve content from other connected clients, thus reducing the load on a central server. WebRTC allows web browsers to open direct communication channels to other web browsers, introducing peer-to-peer solutions to the web application.

Examples range from Web applications, mashups, apps, and mobile devices to enterprise-grade services. Cloud computing is the industrialization of service provision and delivery, where Web and enterprise services are converging on a technological level. The article discusses this technological landscape and, in particular, current trends with respect to cloud computing. The survey focuses on the communication aspect of interaction by reviewing languages, protocols, and architectures that drive today’s standards and software implementations applicable in clouds. Technological advances will affect both client side and service side. There is a trend toward multiplexing, multihoming, and encryption in upcoming transport mechanisms, especially for architectures, where a client simultaneously sends a large number of requests to some service. Furthermore, there are emerging client-to-client communication capabilities in Web clients that could establish a foundation for upcoming Web-based messaging architectures. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Cloud services; Communication protocols; Languages; Service architecture; Service interaction patterns; Web services; Web technology","Cloud computing; Computational linguistics; Distributed database systems; Internet protocols; Mobile devices; Network architecture; Network protocols; Query languages; Social networking (online); Surveys; Websites; Cloud services; Enterprise services; Service architecture; Service interaction; Software implementation; Technological advances; Transport mechanism; Web technologies; Web services",,,,,,"Adams, D., (2011) XEP-0030: Service Discovery, , http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0009.html, Accessed 23 July 2014; Alinone, A., (2011) 10 years of push technology, comet, and websockets, , http://cometdaily.com/2011/07/06/push-technology-comet-and-websockets-10-years-of-history-from-lightstreamers-perspective/, Accessed 17 Feb 2014; Alonso, G., Casati, F., Kuno, H.A., Machiraj, V., (2004) Web services—concepts, architectures and applications, , Springer, Berlin; (2013) Amazon Web Services: Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), , http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/, Accessed 21 Feb 2014; (2011) Apache Software Foundation: Apache ActiveMQ, , http://activemq.apache.org/, Accessed 21 Feb 2014; (2011) Apache Software Foundation: OpenWire version 2 specification, , http://activemq.apache.org/openwire-version-2-specification.html, Accessed 20 Feb 2014; (2012) Apache Software Foundation: Apache abdera: an open source atom implementation, , https://abdera.apache.org/, Accessed 08 May 2014; (2012) Apache Software Foundation: Apache Axis2/Java, , http://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/, Accessed 28 Mar 2014; (2012) Apache Software Foundation: Apache Thrift, , http://thrift.apache.org/, Accessed 20 Feb 2014; (2013) Apache Software Foundation: Apache Etch, , http://etch.apache.org/, Accessed 21 Feb 2014; (2013) Apache Software Foundation: Apache Qpid, , https://qpid.apache.org/, Accessed 21 July 2014; (2014) Apache Software Foundation: Apache Avro 1.7.6 Specification, , http://avro.apache.org/docs/1.7.6/spec.html, Accessed 21 Feb 2014; (2014) Apache Software Foundation: Apache CXF: an open-source services framework, , http://cxf.apache.org/, Accessed 28 Mar 2014; (2014) Apache Software Foundation: Apollo - ActiveMQ’s next generation of messaging, , http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/, Accessed 24 July 2014; (2014) Apache Software Foundation: Hadoop, , http://hadoop.apache.org/, Accessed 10 July 2014; (2014) Apache Software Foundation: Kafka, , http://kafka.apache.org/, Accessed 15 July 2014; (2012) Apple: Property list specification, , http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd, Accessed 21 Feb 2014; (2014) Apple: iOS, 7. , http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5977, Multipath TCP Support in iOS; (2014) Apple: Local and push notifications, , https://developer.apple.com/notifications/, Accessed 12 May 2014; Arends, R., Austein, R., Larson, M., Massey, D., Rose, S., (2005) DNS security introduction and requirements.

IMMP enables integration of the conventional infrastructure with emerging products and technologies, improves monitoring and management capabilities and help transforming the existing infrastructure to Smart Grids (SG) by using the new concepts and standards. IMMP, mainly consists of software application modules and RTUs with embedded software, firmware, drivers and interface modules to communicate with the existing power and energy units and the applications. System data retrieved from all the critical points is validated and recorded in data storage and processed for; displaying the grids' situation on graphical maps, sending alerts to operators, taking automatic actions where applicable and enables analysis of the long term collected data for extracting valuable information to improve efficiency by managing the assets and the workforce more effectively and planning future needs and investments more accurately, which eventually help reducing the costs. © 2015 IEEE.","Demand Side; Energy Efficiency; Monitoring and Management; Prosumer; Remote Terminal Units; Smart Grids",,,,,,,"Grijalva, S., Tariq, M.U., Prosumer-Based Smart Grid Architecture Enables A Flat Sustainable Electricity Industry; Silva, M.P., Saraiva, J.T., Sousa, A.V., A Web browser based DMS-distribution management system Proc. 2000 IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 4, pp. 2338-2343; He, Y., Deng, Y., Lei, J., Zhang, B., A novel architecture of distribution management system Proc. 2000 IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 1, pp. 67-72; Roberts, A., Berry, T., Wilson, W.D., A modern distribution management system for regional electricity companies Proc. 16th 2001 International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution, Part 1: Contributions.

One crucial part in intensive web automation applications, that require real time responses, is for them to execute the navigation sequences in the shortest possible time. The approach of building the automatic web navigation component by using the APIs of conventional browsers, followed by most of the current systems, is not appropriate in that scenario, because it presents performance problems. Other approach consist in creating custom browsers specially designed for web automation, which can develop some improvements based in the peculiarities of the web automation tasks. In this work, we present a new set of techniques and algorithms that allow the parallel evaluation of the scripting code when a custom browser loads a web page. We also outline the components that should be included in the custom browser architecture to implement these techniques. The tests executed with real web sources, to evaluate the validity of our proposal, show that a custom web browser loads the web pages faster when the scripts are executed in parallel using the designed techniques. © 2015 IEEE.","Efficient Execution; Navigation Sequence; Optimization; Parallel Scripting; Web Automation","Air navigation; Automation; Electronic commerce; Integration testing; Optimization; Websites; World Wide Web; Automated testing; Efficient Execution; Optimization techniques; Parallel evaluation; Parallel Scripting; Performance problems; Real time response; Web automation; Web browsers",,,,,,"Anupam, V., Freire, J., Kumar, B., Lieuwen, D., Automating web navigation with the WebVCR (2000) Comput.

This chapter discusses m-learning with respect to video. It outlines the m-learning paradigm in conjunction with the technical aspects of video display in browsers, when varying media formats are used. The <video> tag used in this work renders videos from two sources with different MIME types. Feeds from the video sources, namely YouTube and UCT Matterhorn, are pulled by a Website that acts as a content aggregator. The content aggregator presents the various user-generated contents and lectures from the two repositories to both lecturers and students as a single source. By leveraging on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, the application should render uniform video display and gather comments among various students, who use various personal mobile devices. Results show that a uniform display cannot be achieved when developing an application for personal mobile devices. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,"Ackerman, E., Guizzo, E., Five technologies that will shape the web.

What used to be termed ""e-business"" is now simply business as usual. Today's successful organizations are complex; they are part of dynamic business networks built on digital channels, going far beyond traditional e-business. This text provides invaluable insights of modern e-business integrated with networked business, going much further than the usual analysis of traditional e-business texts. Included is coverage of the Big Five-social media, mobile computing, big data, cloud computing, and the internet of things --as well as service-oriented business and technology. This essential text provides a compact roadmap to networked e-business for engineering, information systems or business students as well as professionals in the field. © 2016 Paul Grefen.

Due to regulation laws and to protect the privacy of users, clients, and business partners, such information must be kept private. This paper proposes a privacy reference architecture that can serve as foundation for the analysis, design and development of web applications with privacy concerns. Using the proposed reference architecture, these applications can manage personal information in a more secure manner, protecting such information from different sources of privacy violation. Also, it can be used as a standardization model that facilitates system integration and communication. The architecture was evaluated regarding four key quality attributes: completeness, applicability, usability and feasibility. Results show that it brings values for the stakeholders and is an important tool in the analysis and implementation of applications with privacy protection.

These resource-limited environments are characterized by dynamic context, limited computing resources, high levels of stress, and intermittent network connectivity. Cyber-foraging is the leverage of external resource-rich surrogates to augment the capabilities of resource-limited devices. In cloudletbased cyber-foraging, resource-intensive computation is offloaded to cloudlets: discoverable, generic servers located in single-hop proximity of mobile devices. This chapter presents several mechanisms for cloudlet-based cyber-foraging that consider a tradeoff space beyond energy, performance, and fidelity of results. It demonstrates that cyber-foraging in resource-limited environments can greatly benefit from moving cloud computing concepts and technologies closer to the edge so that surrogates, even if disconnected from the enterprise, can provide offload capabilities that enhance the computing power of mobile devices © 2015 by IGI Global.

Such applications' main objective is to integrate technology into people's everyday lives, to be of service to them en masse. The form in which this integration is implemented, however, still leaves much room for improvement. Usually, the user must set parameters within the application. When the person's context changes, they have to manually reconfigure the parameters. What was meant to be a commodity in an unforeseen situation then becomes extra noise. This article describes a reference architecture that improves how people are integrated with the IoT, with smartphones doing the connecting.

Since all modern web browsers support JavaScript, it provides a medium that is both easy to distribute for developers and easy to access for users. This paper provides empirical data to answer the question: Is JavaScript fast enough for numerical computations? By measuring and comparing the runtime performance of benchmarks representative of a wide variety of scientific applications, we show that sequential JavaScript is within a factor of 2 of native code. Parallel code usingWebCL shows speed improvements of up to 2.28 over JavaScript for the majority of the benchmarks. © Copyright 2014 ACM.","Benchmark; C; Computational dwarfs; JavaScript; Numerical computation; OpenCL; Parallelism; Web browser; WebCL","Benchmarking; Cesium; High level languages; Java programming language; World Wide Web; Computational dwarfs; Javascript; Numerical computations; OpenCL; Parallelism; WebCL; Web browsers",,,,,,"http://asmjs.org/spec/latest/, asm.js.

Ejidos de Huipulco, Tlalpan, México, D.F., Mexico","Apart from the 20-year anniversary in 2014 of the first publication of the GERAM ('Generalised Enterprise Reference Architecture and Methodology') Enterprise Architecture Framework, the timeliness of this paper lies in the new interest in the use of systems theory in enterprise architecture (EA), and consequently, 'light-weight' architecture frameworks (AFs). Thus, this paper is about the use of systems thinking and systems theory in EA and about how it is possible to reconcile and understand, based on a single overarching framework, the interplay of two major enterprise change endeavours: on one hand enterprise engineering (i.e. deliberate change) and on the other hand evolutionary, organic change. The paper also demonstrates how such change processes can be illustrated by employing systems thinking to construct dynamic business models; the evolution of these concepts is exemplified using past applications in networked enterprise building, and more recent proposals in environmental-, disaster- and healthcare management. Finally, the paper attempts to plot the way GERAM, as a framework to think about the creation and evolution of complex socio-technical systems, will continue to contribute to the society in the context of future challenges and emerging opportunities. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Architecture frameworks; Dynamic business models; Enterprise Architecture; Enterprise engineering; Health-care managements; Networked enterprise; Reference architecture; Sociotechnical systems; System theory",,,,,,"Bernus, P., Nemes, L., A framework to define a generic enterprise reference architecture and methodology (1994) Proc.

If a specific database is not supported from the vendor anymore, its backup tools and dump files are also unusable. Furthermore just backing up database is not a digital archiving because it doesn't guarantee long-term preserving and utilizing database contents. Therefore valuable information that stored in the databases are disappeared due to lack of archiving methods. The purpose of this paper is to design the preservation format and to implement archiving tools for a database digital archiving. For this, we first analyze OAIS reference architecture, standard of a digital archiving and SIARD format. The preservation format for database archiving is defined next based on the related works. For developing archiving tool, the JDBC Driver and the SQL:1999 are used for the accessing and managing various kinds of databases. The experimental tests are performed with the major databases; Oracle, MySQL, MSSQL. The define preservation format and archiving tool can be used for basis studies of long-term preserving of all kind of electronic documents using a database.","Archiving Tool; Database Archiving; Long-term Preservation; Preservation Format","Information management; Database archiving; Database contents; Digital Archiving; Electronic document; Experimental test; Long-term preservation; Reference architecture; Related works; Database systems",,,,,,"Olson, J.E., (2010) Database Archiving: How to Keep Lots of Data for A Very Long Time, , Morgan Kaufmann; Heuscher, S., Järmann, S., Keller-Marxer, P., Möhle, F., (2004) Providing Authentic Long-term Archival Access to Complex Relational Data, , arXiv preprint cs/0408054; (2012) Reference Model for An Open Archival Information System(OAIS), p. 7. , http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf, CCSDS; (2009) SIARD Format Description, , http://www.bar.admin.ch/themen/00532/00536/00818/index.htmllang=en, Swiss Federal Archives; Melton, J., Simon, A.R., (2001) SQL: 1999: Understanding Relational Language Components, , Morgan Kaufmann; Rahman, A.U., David, G., Ribeiro, C., (2012) SIARD Archive Browser, pp. 496-499. , Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries.

The local challenges and expectations for a distribution management system were obtained by visiting several distribution companies (DC) in Turkey. Priorities we identified are; enhancing distribution networks to improve monitoring capabilities, identifying and reducing the losses and theft, managing grids more effectively to improve reliability, efficiency and quality while reducing costs. DC's also willing to incorporate smart grids concept and standards in their network. Consequently, a standards based new approach is derived and developed. It is vendor independent distribution management system (VI-DMS) to be the main platform for enabling the conversion of conventional distribution networks to the SGs and for facilitating the integration of existing components with each other and also with emerging technologies from different suppliers. In this paper, a scheme of the proposed VI-DMS architecture is also presented. © 2015 IEEE.","Distribution Management Systems; Embedded Systems; Remote Terminal Unit; Smart Grids; Turkish EMRA","Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Distribution companies; Distribution management systems; Emerging technologies; Monitoring capabilities; New approaches; Remote terminal units; Smart grid; Turkishs; Smart power grids",,,,,,"Silva, M.P., Saraiva, J.T., Sousa, A.V., A Web browser based DMSdistribution management system Proc. 2000 IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 4, pp. 2338-2343; He, Y., Deng, Y., Lei, J., Zhang, B., A novel architecture of distribution management system Proc. 2000 IEEE Power Engineering Society Summer Meeting, 1, pp. 67-72; Roberts, A., Berry, T., Wilson, W.D., A modern distribution management system for regional electricity companies Proc. 16th 2001 International Conference and Exhibition on Electricity Distribution, Part 1: Contributions.

Most current systems build the automatic web navigation component by using the APIs of conventional browsers. This approach suffers performance problems for intensive web automation tasks which require real time responses and/or a high degree of parallelism. Other systems use the approach of creating custom browsers to avoid some of the tasks of conventional browsers, but they work like them, when building the internal representation of the web pages. In this paper, we present a complete architecture for a custom browser able to efficiently execute web navigation sequences. The proposed architecture supports some novel automatic optimization techniques that can be applied when loading and building the internal representation of the pages. The tests performed using real web sources show that the reference implementation of the proposed architecture runs significantly faster than other navigation components © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Browser architecture; Optimization; Web automation","Automation; Information systems; Integration testing; Optimization; Systems engineering; Websites; World Wide Web; Automatic optimization; Degree of parallelism; Internal representation; Performance problems; Proposed architectures; Real time response; Reference implementation; Web automation; Architecture",,,,,,"http://www.alexa.com, The Web Information CompanyAnupam, V., Freire, J., Kumar, B., Lieuwen, D., Automating web navigation with the WebVCR (2000) Comput.

In parallel with their popularity, the complexity of aesthetics and functionality of web applications have also increased significantly, creating a big challenge for maintenance and cross-browser compliance testing. Since such testing and verification activities require visual analysis, web application testing has not been sufficiently automated. In this paper, we propose a novel pairwise image comparison approach suitable for web application testing where the location of layout faults needs to be detected efficiently while insignificant variations being neglected. This technique is developed based on the characteristics of fault patterns of browser layouts. An empirical study conducted with the industry partner shows our approach is more effective and efficient than existing methods in this area. © 2014 IEEE.","adaptive random testing; image comparison;

The honeypot concept has been used in general-purpose intrusion detection systems for a long time, with well-recognized contributions in revealing and analysing cyber attacks. However, a number of specialized requirements associated with SCADA systems within Industrial Control Systems in general are not addressed by typical honeypots. In this paper we discuss how the different approaches to security of typical information systems and industrial control systems lead to the need of specialized SCADA honeypots for process control networks. Based on that discussion, we propose a reference architecture for a SCADA network honeypot, discuss possible implementation strategies—based on the lessons learned from the development of a proof-of-concept Modbus honeypot—and propose two alternative deployment strategies, one based on low cost hardware appliances physically and logically located in the automation or field networks and the other based on virtualized field network honeypots physically located in the datacentre and logically located in the field or automation network. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015",,,,,,,,"Enterprise-control system integration part 1: Models and terminology (2000) ISA, p. 2000. , ANSI/ISA-95.00.01; Baecher, P., Koetter, M., Holz, T., Dornseif, M., Freiling, F., The nepenthes platform: An efficient approach to collect malware (2006) Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 4219, pp. 165-184. , Recent advances in intrusion detection, Springer, Berlin; Bos, H., (2009) Shelia: A Client-Side Honeypot for Attack Detection, , http://www.cs.vu.nl/*herbertb/misc/shelia/, Accessed 10 Sept 2013; Case, J., Fedor, M., Schoffstall, M., Davin, J., A simple network management protocol (SNMP) (1990) IETF RFC, 1157. , May; (2004) SCADA Honeynet, , http://scadahoneynet.sourceforge.net/, Project, Accessed 10 Sept 2013; Clarke, G., Reynders, D., (2004) Practical Modern SCADA Protocols: DNP3, 60870.5 and Related Systems, , IDC Technologies, Oxford; (2013) Cybersecurity on SCADA: Risk Prediction, Analysis and Reaction Tools for Critical Infrastructures, , http://www.CockpitCI.eu/, Cockpit CI, FP7 SEC-285647 project website, Accessed 10 Sept 2013; Creery, A., Byres, E., Industrial cybersecurity for power system and SCADA networks (2005) Industry Applications Society 52Nd Annual Petroleum and Chemical Industry Conference, pp. 303-309. , IEEE; Davis, C.M., Tate, J.E., Okhravi, H., Grier, C., Overbye, T.J., Nicol, D., SCADA cyber security testbed development (2006) 38Th North American Power Symposium.

In this context, effective cooperation and interoperability of the healthcare effort participants and their information systems is paramount but often hindered by the typically hierarchical and heterogeneous character of healthcare institutions. In the new context, governments can no longer apply traditional healthcare information and organisational paradigms. Novel holistic and integrated models are required, taking into account aspects, elements and life cycles of all healthcare effort participants. Building on previous research and applications, this paper employs conceptual development and case study to create a modelling framework drawing on information systems, interoperability, collaborative networks and enterprise architecture disciplines in order to build the artefacts required for truly collaborative healthcare information systems. It is found that this multi-faceted approach provides a feasible theoretical and practical platform for sustainable collaborative information systems solutions to current and emerging population health and well-being challenges.

In this article the requirements of CPPS and abilities of agents as enabling technology are discussed. The applicability of agents for realizing CPPS is exemplarily shown based on three selected use cases with different requirements regarding real-time and dependability. The paper finally concludes with opportunities and open research issues that need to be faced in order to achieve agent-based CPPSs. © 2015 Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston 2015 Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS.","agent; Cyber-physical production systems; Industrie 4.0; multi-agent systems",,,,,,,"(2006) MANUFUTURE Strategic Research Agenda -Assuring the Future of Manufacturing in Europe., , European Commission; (2012) European Factory of the Future Association: Factories of the Future PPP Fof 2020 Roadmap -Consultation Document.; (2011) Acatech: Cyper-physical Systems -Driving Force for Innovation in Mobility, Health, Energy and Production -Position Paper; http://www.whitehouse.gov/thepress-office/2014/02/25/president-obama-announces-twonew-public-private-manufacturing-innovatio, Office of the Press Secretary: President Obama Announces Two New Public-Private Manufacturing Innovation Institutes and Launches the First of Four New Manufacturing Innovation Institute Competitions [Accessed: 29-Sep-2014]Legat, C., Lamparter, S., Vogel-Heuser, B., Knowledge-based technologies for future factory engineering and control (2013) Service Orientation in Holonic and Multi Agent Manufacturing and Robotics, pp. 355-374. , Springer Berlin Heidelberg; Vogel-Heuser, B., Diedrich, C., Pantforder, D., Gohner, P., Coupling heterogeneous production systems by amulti-agent based cyber-physical production system (2014) IEEE International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN; Lee, J., Wang, H., New technologies for maintenance (2008) Complex System Maintenance Handbook, pp. 49-78. , Springer, London; Folmer, J., Vogel-Heuser, B., Computing dependent industrial alarms for alarm flood reduction (2012) International Multi-Conference on Systems Signals and Devices, pp. 1-6; Legat, C., Vogel-Heuser, B., An orchestration engine for services-oriented field level automation software (2014) Workshop on Service Orientation in Holonic and Multi-AgentManufacturing; Legat, C., Seitz, C., Lamparter, S., Feldmann, S., Semantics to the shop floor: Towards ontology modularization and reuse in the automation domain (2014) 19th IFAC World Congress, pp. 3444-3449; Weiss, G., (1999) Multiagent Systems: Amodern Approach to Distributed Artificial Intelligence., , MIT Press; Russel, S., Norvig, P., (2010) Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, , Ed. 3 Peason; Leitao, P., Agent-based distributed manufacturing control: A state-of-the-art survey (2009) Eng.

Complutense 30, Madrid, Spain","Context: Quality control comprises the set of activities aimed to evaluate that software meets its specification and delivers the functionality expected by the consumers. These activities are often removed in the development process and, as a result, the final software product usually lacks quality. Objective: We propose a set of techniques to automate the quality control for web applications from the client-side, guiding the process by functional and non-functional requirements (performance, security, compatibility, usability and accessibility). Method: The first step to achieve automation is to define the structure of the web navigation. Existing software artifacts in the phase of analysis and design are reused. Then, the independent paths of navigation are found, and each path is traversed automatically using real browsers while different kinds of assessments are carried out. Results: The processes and methods proposed in this paper have been implemented by means of a reference architecture and open source tools. A laboratory experiment and an industrial case study have been performed in order to validate the proposal. Conclusion: The definition of navigation paths is a rich approach to model web applications. Grey-box (black-box and white-box) methods have been proved to be very valuable for web assessment. The Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is an optimal way to find the independent paths in a web navigation modeled as a directed graph. © 2015, Rinton Press.","Automated software testing; Functional assessment; Graph theory; Non-functional assessment; Web applications; Web navigation","Air navigation; Application programs; Automation; Directed graphs; Functional assessment; Graph theory; Open source software; Quality assurance; Social networking (online); Software testing; World Wide Web; Automated software testing; Chinese postman problem; Industrial case study; Laboratory experiments; Non-functional requirements; Reference architecture; WEB application; Web navigation; Quality control",,,,,,"Becker, S.A., Berkemeyer, A., Rapid application design and testing of web usability (2002) MultiMedia, IEEE, 9 (4), pp. 38-46. , oct-dec; Dustin, E., Garrett, T., Gauf, B., (2009) Implementing Automated Software Testing: How to Save Time and Lower Costs While Raising Quality, , Prentice Hall; Automated Testing Institute, (2011) Test Automation Body of Knowledge (TABOK)., , Automated Testing Institute; (2001) Software engineering - Product quality - Part 1: Quality model., , ISO.

It is not solely limited to the actual Internet traversal, a sub-problem vastly tackled by consolidated research in security protocol design and analysis. By contrast, it entails much broader dimensions pertaining to how users approach technology and understand the risks for the data they enter. For example, users may express cautious or distracted personas depending on the service and the point in time; further, pre-established paths of practice may lead them to neglect the intrusive privacy policy offered by a service, or the outdated protections adopted by another. The approach that sees the service security and privacy problem as a socio-technical one needs consolidation. With this motivation, the article makes a threefold contribution. It reviews the existing literature on service security and privacy, especially from the socio-technical standpoint. Further, it outlines a general research methodology aimed at layering the problem appropriately, at suggesting how to position existing findings, and ultimately at indicating where a transdisciplinary task force may fit in. The article concludes with the description of the three challenge domains of services whose security and privacy we deem open socio-technical problems, not only due to their inherent facets but also to their huge number of users. © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

The authors from computer science and automation provide an interdisciplinary survey on challenges and state of the art in evolution of automated production systems. Selected challenges are illustrated on the case of a simple pick and place unit. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the development process of automated production systems as well as the different type of evolutions during the system's life-cycle on the case of a pick and place unit. In the second part, we survey the challenges associated with evolution in the different development phases and a couple of cross-cutting areas and review existing approaches addressing the challenges. We close with summarizing future research directions to address the challenges of evolution in automated production systems. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

On one hand, supported frameworks vary from one Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to another depending on their implementations and capacities. On the other hand, each PaaS provides a specific and proprietary scenario to provision adequate resources and to deploy applications. In this paper, we propose a new PaaS-independent approach to provision in a unified way, appropriate PaaS resources for applications deployment in Cloud platforms. Our approach aims at addressing vendor lock-in restrictions and applications portability issues in existing Cloud platforms. To that end, we define a unified description model based on the Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI) core model that allows describing and managing an abstract Cloud resource. Our defined model consists of two main parts: (1) an OCCI platform extension which describes PaaS resources that can be provisioned by a PaaS to set-up an appropriate environment and (2) an OCCI application extension which describes application resources to deploy an application in this environment. We show the feasibility of our approach with an implementation and a use case of a realistic deployment scenario in Cloud Foundry PaaS. © 2014 The British Computer Society.

They provide unauthorized access and damage or disrupt user information within or outside the browser. This chapter focuses on the complete attack actions adopted by an attacker while crafting an attack on Web browser. The knowledge gained from the attacker's actions can be framed into a suitable taxonomy, which can then be used as a framework for examining the browser attack footprints, vulnerability in browser design, and helps one to understand the characteristics and nature of an attacker. This chapter presents a browser attack taxonomy that helps in combating new browser attacks and improving browser security. © 2015 by IGI Global.

In this way, for each device (computers, smart phones, etc.) with an installed browser, it is possible to perform peer-to-peer real-time communications natively, for instance, video and voice calls, chatting or instant messaging, file sharing and screen sharing. This recent technology has grown exponentially both in implemented solutions and in browsers compatibility. WebRTC is therefore an evolutionary technology with a strong growth, where more solutions Over-The-Top (OTT) could appear and where the telecommunications operators could invest creating their own service solutions. Facing the lack of standards regarding the communication between WebRTC endpoints, this paper studies in depth the WebRTC technology in order to identify its potential and to assess in which way it could impact on the telecommunications world. This paper also presents a framework that helps developing WebRTC applications and services at a higher level. As proof-of-concept a WebRTC client is developed to allow testing the services implemented in the framework. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",,"Distributed computer systems; Information services; Information systems; Instant messaging; Proof of concept; Real time service; Real-time communication; Screen sharing; Standard technology; Strong growth; Telecommunications operators; Technology",,,,,,"(2012), http://singlepageappbook.com/, Single page apps in depth(2011), http://www.webrtc.org/reference/architecture, WebRTC: General OverviewLoreto, S., Romano, S.P., Real-Time Communications in the Web: Issues, Achievements, and Ongoing Standardization Efforts (2012) IEEE Computer Society, 16 (5), pp. 68-73; Johnston, A., Burnett, D., (2012) WebRTC: APIs and RTCweb Protocols of the HTML5 Real-Time Web, , 1st edn.

Biological metaphors of living adaptable ecosystems provide the logical foundation for self-optimizing and self-healing run-time environments for intelligent adaptable business services and related information systems with service-oriented enterprise architectures. The present research in progress work investigates mechanisms for adaptable enterprise architectures for the development of service-oriented ecosystems with integrated technologies like Semantic Technologies, Web Services, Cloud Computing and Big Data Management. With a large and diverse set of ecosystem services with different owners, our scenario of service-based SmartLife ecosystems can pose challenges in their development, and more importantly, for maintenance and software evolution. Our research explores the use of knowledge modeling using ontologies and flexible metamodels for adaptable enterprise architectures to support program comprehension for software engineers during maintenance and evolution tasks of service-based applications. Our previous reference enterprise architecture model ESARC - Enterprise Services Architecture Reference Cube - and the Open Group SOA Ontology was extended to support agile semantic analysis, program comprehension and software evolution for a SmartLife applications scenario. The Semantic Browser is a semantic search tool that was developed to provide knowledge-enhanced investigation capabilities for service-oriented applications and their architectures. © 2014 IEEE.","Adaptive Enterprise Reference Architecture;

The planet Mars is the target body in this study and the outbound Trans-Mars injection in the years between 2175 and 2199 will be analyzed (within this timeframe Bennu's orbit is predicted to approach Earth within two Earth radii on at least 80 occasions). The Mars orbit insertion burn, Trans-Earth injection burn, and Earth orbit insertion burn are assumed to be achieved with propulsive maneuvers outlined in standard manned interplanetary mission architectures. To accomplish this mission, two methods of transferring kinetic energy are examined: direct capture and release of the asteroid by a spacecraft using a Kevlar net and an inertial reel, and establishing a station on the asteroid to manufacture compressed material from the carbonaceous regolith in order to fire a mass stream to be captured by the spacecraft. This mission architecture analysis takes into account the associated safety risks of perturbations within Bennu's orbit (which could result in inaccurate rendezvous location predictions), the implications of altering the orbit of 101955 Bennu after transferring a portion of its energy (since there is a possibility of collision with Earth in the late 22nd century if the asteroid is slowed too significantly), g-limit restrictions of the spacecraft and its occupants during an acceleration by the asteroid, and the possibility of a collision between Bennu and the spacecraft. In addition, the cost-benefit considerations of this mission architecture are weighed. This examination concludes that a direct capture Net and Reel system aboard the spacecraft is not a viable capture method due to an insufficient maximum ΔV available through a best-case perfectly elastic collision (capture) with the asteroid, as well as a prohibitive weight penalty aboard the spacecraft due to the Net and Reel system. However, this report finds that the method of establishing a station on Bennu with the capability to separate mass from the asteroid and fire it at a spacecraft is a plausible (if costly) means of transferring a significant ΔV. A KETNEO-FIMM Asteroid Station mission architecture could also be used in subsequent interplanetary missions providing cost-sharing over many decades for future interplanetary missions.",,"Architecture; Asteroids; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Energy transfer; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Martian surface analysis; Neutron absorption; Orbits; Reels; Risk assessment; Spacecraft observatories; Spacecraft propulsion; Elastic collision; Interplanetary manned missions; Interplanetary mission; Location prediction; Mars orbit insertion burns; Mission architectures; Near earth objects; Source of energy; Space rendezvous",,,,,,"Drake, B., (2014) NASA Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0, p. 27. , http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/373665main_NASA-SP-2009-566.pdf, NASA, July 2009.

Recent research has focused on so-called choreographed IWC approaches that enable selforganization of the aggregated components based on their messaging capabilities. Though a manual configuration of communication paths is not required anymore, such solutions bear several problems related to awareness and control of the emerging message flow. This paper presents a systematic approach to tackle these problems in the context of hybrid user interface mashups. We show how users can be made aware of the emerged IWC configuration and how they can adjust it to their needs. A reference architecture for development of hybrid mashup platforms, is derived and one implementation based on the publish-subscribe choreography model is given. We report on the results of a first user study and outline directions for the future research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","End-user development; Inter-widget communication; User interface mashup; Widgets","Human computer interaction; Choreography models; End user development; Generic transformations; Hybrid User Interfaces; Mash-up; Reference architecture; Self organizations; Widgets; User interfaces",,,,,"257635, EC, European Commission","Bellifemine, F., Caire, G., Poggi, A., Rimassa, G., JADE: A White Paper (2003) EXP in Search of Innovation, 3 (3), pp. 6-19; Cappiello, C., Daniel, F., Matera, M., Picozzi, M., Weiss, M., Enabling end user development through mashups: Requirements, abstractions and innovation toolkits (2011) IS-EUD 2011.

Since all modern web browsers support JavaScript, it provides a medium that is both easy to distribute for developers and easy to access for users. This paper provides empirical data to answer the question: Is JavaScript fast enough for numerical computations? By measuring and comparing the runtime performance of benchmarks representative of a wide variety of scientific applications, we show that sequential JavaScript is within a factor of 2 of native code. Parallel code using WebCL shows speed improvements of up to 2.28 over JavaScript for the majority of the benchmarks.

One of the core assumptions on which browser security is built is that there is no cross-origin feedback loop from the client to the server. However, the screen sharing API allows creating a cross-origin feedback loop. Consequently, websites will potentially be able to see all visible content from the user's screen, irrespective of its origin. This cross-origin feedback loop, when combined with human vision limitations, can introduce new vulnerabilities. An attacker can capture sensitive information from victim's screen using the new API without the consensus of the victim. We investigate the security implications of the screen sharing API and discuss how existing defenses against traditional web attacks fail during screen sharing. We show that several attacks are possible with the help of the screen sharing API: cross-site request forgery, history sniffing, and information stealing. We discuss how popular websites such as Amazon and Wells Fargo can be attacked using this API and demonstrate the consequences of the attacks such as economic losses, compromised account and information disclosure. The objective of this paper is to present the attacks using the screen sharing API, analyze the fundamental cause and motivate potential defenses to design a more secure screen sharing API. © 2014 IEEE.","Browser Security; HTML5; Screen Sharing","HTML; Losses; Websites; Browser security; Economic loss; Feed-back loop; HTML5; Information disclosure; Screen sharing; Security implications; Sensitive informations; Internet",,,,,,"(2013) Google Voice and Video Chat, , https://www.google.com/chat/video; (2013) Web Real-time Communications Working Group, , http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc/; (2013) Webrtc General Overview, , http://www.webrtc.org/reference/architecture; (2013) Webrtc Interop Notes, , http://www.webrtc.org/interop; Roth, V., Richter, K., Freidinger, R., A pin-entry method resilient against shoulder surfing (2004) Proceedings of the 11th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 25-29. , ACM; (2013) Chrome Autofill Forms, , http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=142893; (2013) Stable Channel Update, , http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2013/07/stable-channel-update.html; Bidelman, E., (2012) Chrome Extension Api with Binary Websocket, , http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/streaming/screenshare/#toc-method3; Bidelman, E., (2012) Screensharing A Browser Tab in html5?, , http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/streaming/screenshare; Bidelman, E., (2012) Capturing Audio & Video in html5, , http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/; Grossman, J., (2010) Breaking Browsers: Hacking Auto-complete, , http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2010/08/breaking-browsers-hacking-auto-complete.html; Lits, A.M., (2010) Apple-sa-2010-07-28-1 Safari 5.0.1 and Safari 4.1.1, , http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2010//Jul/msg00001.html; (2009) Bug 527935 - (cve-2011-0067) Untrusted Events Should Not Trigger Autocomplete Popup, , https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showbug.cgi?id=527935; Barth, A., Jackson, C., Mitchell, J.C., Robust defenses for crosssite request forgery (2008) Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Rydstedt, G., Bursztein, E., Boneh, D., Jackson, C., Busting frame busting: A study of clickjacking vulnerabilities on popular sites (2010) Web 2.0 Security and Privacy; (2014) Bug 624883-Iframe with Src=""view-source⋯"" Should Be Treated As An Unknown Scheme, , https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showbug.cgi?id=624883; Grossman, J., (2010) Proof-of-concept: Safari Autofill Attack, , http://ha.ckers.org/weird/safariautofill.html; OWASP, (2013) HTTP Csrf Cheat Sheet, , https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site, Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet; Vela, E., (2011) Css Attribute Reader Proof of Concept, , http://eaea.sirdarckcat.net/cssar/v2/; Heiderich, M., Niemietz, M., Schuster, F., Holz, T., Schwenk, J., Scriptless attacks: Stealing the pie without touching the sill (2012) Proceedings of the 2012 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 760-771. , ACM; (2013) Own Facebook Exploit - Silently Post to the Wall Friends Walls of Visitors to Your Site, , http://www.blackhatworld.com/blackhat-seo/facebook/597969-own-facebook-exploit-silently-post-wall-friends-walls-visitors-your-site.html; Oda, T., Wurster, G., Van Oorschot, P.C., Somayaji, A., SOMA: Mutual approval for included content in web pages (2008) Proceedings of the 15th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security; Chen, E.Y., Bau, J., Reis, C., Barth, A., Jackson, C., App isolation: Get the security of multiple browsers with just one (2011) Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security, pp. 227-238. , ACM; Wang, H.J., Grier, C., Moshchuk, A., King, S.T., Choudhury, P., Venter, H., The multi-principal os construction of the gazelle web browser (2009) USENIX Security Symposium, pp. 417-432; Cox, R.S., Hansen, J.G., Gribble, S.D., Levy, H.M., A safetyoriented platform for web applications (2006) Security and Privacy, 2006 IEEE Symposium on, p. 15. , IEEE; Mao, Z., Li, N., Molloy, I., Defeating cross-site request forgery attacks with browser-enforced authenticity protection (2009) Financial Cryptography and Data Security, pp. 238-255. , Springer; Jakobsson, M., Stamm, S., Invasive browser sniffing and countermeasures (2006) Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 523-532. , ACM; Saxena, P., Molnar, D., Livshits, B., (2010) Scriptgard: Preventing Script Injection Attacks in Legacy Web Applications with Automatic Sanitization, , Citeseer, Tech.

While about ten years ago only text and images with small file sizes (and as a result small resolutions) could be used, it is possible to watch high quality multimedia presentations nowadays. But those rarely exist because of tedious to learn authoring tools. A specialization to one main medium, in our case video, allows creating efficient authoring tools using well known paradigms. This work introduces an authoring tool called SIVA Producer. An iterative process for improving the usability of the authoring tool is described. Furthermore, a distinction of the terms ""interactive video"", ""annotated video"", ""non-linear video"" and ""hypervideo"" is given. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Authoring; Interactive video; Non-linear video; Scene graph; Usability; Video annotations","Hardware; Multimedia systems; Authoring; Interactive video; Non-linear videos; Scene graph; Usability; Video annotations; World Wide Web",,,,,,"Abowd, G.D., Gauger, M., Lachenmann, A., The family video archive: An annotation and browsing environment for home movies (2003) Proceedings of the 5th ACM SIGMM International Workshop on Multimedia Information Retrieval, MIR '03, pp. 1-8. , ACM, New York; Aubert, O., Prié, Y., Advene: Active reading through hypervideo (2005) Proceedings of the Sixteenth ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia, HYPERTEXT '05, pp. 235-244. , ACM, New York; Aubert, O., Prié, Y., Advene: An open-source framework for integrating and visualising audiovisual metadata (2007) MULTIMEDIA '07: Proc. of the 15th International Conference on Multimedia, pp. 1005-1008. , ACM, New York; Baecker, R., Rosenthal, A.J., Friedlander, N., Smith, E., Cohen, A., A multimedia system for authoring motion pictures (1996) Proceedings of the Fourth ACM International Conference on Multimedia, MULTIMEDIA '96, pp. 31-42. , ACM, New York; Bouyakoub, S., Belkhir, A., Smil builder: An incremental authoring tool for smil documents (2011) ACM Trans Multimedia Comput Commun Appl, 7, pp. 2:1-2:30; Buring, T., Gerken, J., Reiterer, H., User interaction with scatterplots on small screens - A comparative evaluation of geometric-semantic zoom and fisheye distortion (2006) IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 12 (5), pp. 829-836. , DOI 10.1109/TVCG.2006.187; Bulterman, D.C.A., Hardman, L., Structured multimedia authoring (2005) ACM Trans Multimedia Comput Commun Appl, 1 (1), pp. 89-109; Bulterman, D.C.A., Hardman, L., Jansen, J., Mullender, K.S., Rutledge, L., Grins: A graphical interface for creating and playing smil documents (1998) Comput Networks, 30 (1-7), pp. 519-529; Carlsson, N., Mahanti, A., Li, Z., Eager, D., Optimized periodic broadcast of nonlinear media (2008) IEEE Trans Multimedia, 10 (5), pp. 871-884; Chambel, T., Zahn, C., Finke, M., Hypervideo design and support for contextualized learning (2004) Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 345-349. , IEEE Computer Society, Washington, DC; Chang, H.B., Huang Hsu, H., Liao, Y.C., Shih, T., Tang, C.T., An object-based hypervideo authoring system (2004) IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo, 2004.

In such an environment, security techniques to strongly protect sensitive data in mobile devices are important and challenging. To address such challenges, we introduce the concept of the trusted data vault, a small trusted engine that securely manages the storage and usage of sensitive data in an untrusted mobile device. In this paper, we design and build Droid Vault-the first realization of a trusted data vault on the Android platform. Droid Vault establishes a secure channel between data owners and data users while allowing data owners to enforce strong control over the sensitive data with a minimal trusted computing base (TCB). We prototype Droid Vault via the novel use of hardware security features of ARM processors, i.e., Trust Zone. Our evaluation demonstrates its functionality for processing sensitive data and its practicality for adoption in the real world. © 2014 IEEE.","Mobile system security; Operating system security; Technologies for trustworthy computing","Data vault; Mobile systems; Operating system security; Trustworthy computing",,,,,"R-252-000-519-112, MOE, Ministry of Education","Zhou, Y., Jiang, X., Dissecting android malware: Characterization and evolution (2012) IEEE SP; Kostiainen, K., Ekberg, J.-E., Asokan, N., Rantala, A., On-board credentials with open provisioning (2009) ASIACCS; Zhang, X., Aciiçmez, O., Seifert, J.-P., A trusted mobile phone reference architecture via secure kernel (2007) STC; Winter, J., Trusted computing building blocks for embedded linux-based ARM trustzone platforms (2008) STC; Dietrich, K., Winter, J., Towards customizable, application specific mobile trusted modules (2010) STC; Peinado, M., Chen, Y., Engl, P., Manferdelli, J., NGSCB: A trusted open system (2004) ACISP; Lampson, B., Privacy and security usable security: How to get it (2009) Commun.

The possibility of paying-as-you-go mixed with an on-demand elastic operation is changing the enterprise computing model, shifting on-premises infrastructures to off-premises data centers, accessed over the Internet and managed by cloud hosting providers. Regardless of its advantages, the transition to this computing paradigm raises security concerns, which are the subject of several studies. Besides of the issues derived from Web technologies and the Internet, clouds introduce new issues that should be cleared out first in order to further allow the number of cloud deployments to increase. This paper surveys the works on cloud security issues, making a comprehensive review of the literature on the subject. It addresses several key topics, namely vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks, proposing a taxonomy for their classification. It also contains a thorough review of the main concepts concerning the security state of cloud environments and discusses several open research topics. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cloud computing; Clouds; Issues; Security; Survey","Cloud computing; Clouds; Internet; Surveying; Cloud deployments; Cloud environments; Cloud securities; Computing paradigm; Enterprise computing; Issues; Security; Web technologies; Surveys",,,,,,"(2013), https://57un.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/a-big-password-cracking-wordlist/, 57un Blog: A BIG Password Cracking Wordlist, Accessed May 2013Aguiar, E., Zhang, Y., Blanton, M., (2013) An Overview of Issues and Recent Developments in Cloud Computing and Storage Security, pp. 1-31. , Berlin: Springer; Ahuja, S.P., Komathukattil, D., A survey of the state of cloud security (2012) Netw.

As Cloud consumers value QoS (Quality of Service), Cloud providers should make certain service level commitments in order to achieve business success. This paper argues for Cloud service negotiation. It outlines a research roadmap, reviews the state of the art, and reports our work on Cloud service negotiation. Three research problems that we formulate are QoS measurement, QoS negotiation, and QoS enforcement. To address QoS measurement, we pioneer a quality model named CLOUDQUAL for Cloud services. To address QoS negotiation, we propose a tradeoff negotiation approach for Cloud services, which can achieve a higher utility. We also give some ideas to solve QoS enforcement, and balance utility and success rate for QoS negotiation. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud service negotiation; QoS enforcement; QoS measurement; QoS negotiation","Business success; Cloud service negotiations; QoS (quality of service); QoS measurement; QoS negotiation; Quality modeling; Research problems; Research roadmap; Application programs; Quality of service; Research; Web services; Distributed database systems",,,,,,"Alhamad, M., Dillon, T., Chang, E., Conceptual SLA Framework for Cloud Computing (2010) Proc. of the 4th IEEE International Conference on Digital Ecosystems and Technologies (DEST 2010), Dubai, United Arab Emirates; (2013) Aliyun Open Storage Service (Aliyun OSS), , http://www.aliyun.com/product?spm=0.0.0.61.9ec0b1&type-=oss#detail, February 26.

This PaaS providers' policy is hampering the interactions between different clouds. If appropriate solutions are not considered, this issue would for instance slow down the democratization of clouds federation and cooperation. In this paper, we propose (i) a unified description model that allows the representation of applications independently of the targeted PaaS for their hosting and (ii) a generic PaaS application provisioning and management API (called COAPS API). Our proposed solution applies the separation of concerns principle by separating the provisioning and the management API from the defined description model.

Using virtualization technologies, it is economical and feasible to provide testbeds in the cloud. The convergence of Next Generation (NG) networks and Internet-based applications may result in the deployment of future rich Internet applications and services in the cloud. This chapter shows the migration of mobility-enabled services to the cloud. It presents a SIP-based hybrid architecture for Web session mobility that offers content sharing and session handoff between Web browsers. The implemented system has recently evolved to a framework for developing different kinds of converged services over the Internet, which are similar to services offered by Google Wave and existing telephony Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). In addition, the work in this chapter is compared with those similar technologies. Lastly, the authors show efforts to migrate the SIP/HTTP application server to the cloud, which was necessitated by the need to include more functionalities (i.e., QoS and rich media support) as well as to provide large-scale deployment in a multi-domain scenario. © 2013, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,"Adeyeye, M., (2009) The TransferHTTP Controller, , http://transferhttp.berlios.de, Retrieved October 13, 2011, from; Adeyeye, M., (2009) The TransferHTTP Extension, , http://transferhttp.mozdev.org, Retrieved October 13, 2011, from; Adeyeye, M., Ventura, N., A SIP-based web client for HTTP session mobility and multimedia services (2010) Computer Communications, 33 (8), pp. 954-964. , doi:10.1016/j.comcom.2010.01.015; Adeyeye, M., Ventura, N., Foschini, L., Converged multimedia services in emerging web 2.0 session mobility scenarios (2012) Wireless Networks, 18 (2), pp. 185-197. , doi:10.1007/s11276-011-0394-z; Adeyeye, M., Ventura, N., Humphrey, D., Control services for the HTTP session mobility service (2009) Proceedings of the 3rd IEEE Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS), , In, Cairo, Egypt: IEEE Press; (2008) Access to Knowledge Through the Grid in the Mobile World, , http://www.mobilegrids.org, Akogrimo Project, Retrieved October 13, 2011, from; Bhat, R.R., Tait, D., JAVA APIs for integrated networks (2001) Java in Telecommunications: Solutions for Next Generation Networks, p. 193. , In Jespen, T.

A Trojan has the ability to modify Web pages and online transaction content, or insert itself in a covert manner, without the user noticing anything suspicious. This chapter presents a study of several man-in-the-browser attacks that tamper with the user's transactions and examines different attack vectors on several software layers. We conclude that there are many possible points of attack on different software layers and components of a Web browser, as the user's transaction data flows through these layers. We also propose some countermeasures to mitigate these attacks. Our conceptual solution is based on cryptographic identification and integrity monitoring of software components. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Most existing systems store provenance data in provenance stores with proprietary provenance data models and conduct query processing over the physical provenance storages using query languages, such as SQL, SPARQL, and XQuery, which are closely coupled to the underlying storage strategies. Querying provenance at such low level leads to poor usability of the system: a user needs to know the underlying schema to formulate queries; if the schema changes, queries need to be reformulated; and queries formulated for one system will not run in another system. In this paper, we present OPQL, a provenance query language that enables the querying of provenance directly at the graph level. An OPQL query takes a provenance graph as input and produces another provenance graph as output. Therefore, OPQL queries are not tightly coupled to the underlying provenance storage strategies. Our main contributions are: (i) we design OPQL, including six types of graph patterns, a provenance graph algebra, and OPQL syntax and semantics, that supports querying provenance at the graph level; (ii) we implement OPQL using a Web service via our OPMProv system; therefore, users can invoke the Web service to execute OPQL queries in a provenance browser, called OPMProVis. The result of OPQL queries is displayed as a provenance graph in OPMProVis. An experimental study is conducted to evaluate the feasibility and performance of OPMProv on OPQL provenance querying. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","OPQL; Provenance query language; Scientific workflow provenance","Existing systems; Graph patterns; OPQL; Schema changes; Scientific data analysis; Scientific workflow provenances; Scientific workflows; Tightly-coupled; Digital storage; Semantics; Web services; Websites; Query languages",,,,,,"Chebotko, A., Lu, S., Fei, X., Fotouhi, F., RDFProv: A relational RDF store for querying and managing scientific workflow provenance (2010) Data Knowl.

In particular in the area of the user-friendly manual and semi-automatic creation of rich semantic content we have observed recently a large number of approaches and systems being described in the literature. With this survey we aim to provide an overview on the rapidly emerging field of Semantic Content Authoring (SCA). We conducted a systematic literature review comprising a thorough analysis of 31 primary studies out of 175 initially retrieved papers addressing the semantic authoring of textual content. We obtained a comprehensive set of quality attributes for SCA systems together with corresponding user interface features suggested for their realization. The quality attributes include aspects such as usability, automation, generalizability, collaboration, customizability and evolvability. The primary studies were surveyed in the light of these quality attributes and we performed a thorough analysis of four SCA systems. The proposed quality attributes and UI features facilitate the evaluation of existing approaches and the development of novel more effective and intuitive semantic authoring interfaces. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the collaboration puts obstacles in the way of software development when the involved people in the project are scattered over the world. Although Internet has provided a collection of scattered islands in which the denizens of the islands are able to communicate with each other, it lacks full requisite qualifications for the collaboration among the denizens. The emerging idea is that a supportive environment should be developed on the Web for providing full requisite qualifications and facilitating collaboration. Towards providing such an environment, this chapter aims to present a framework exploiting Open Hypermedia System (OHS) and a Web-based collaboration protocol. OHS assists in saving and restoring artifacts constructed by the scattered people, and the protocol provides channels to concurrent communication and distributed authoring among the people. © 2014, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,"Albrecht, J., College, W., Braud, R., Dao, D., Topilski, N., Tuttle, C., Snoeren, A.C., Remote control: Distributed application configuration management, and visualization with Plush (2007) Proceedings of the 21st Large Installation System Administration, pp. 183-201; Anderson, K., Taylor, R., Whitehead, E., Chimera: Hypertext for heterogeneous software development environments (1999) ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 18 (3), pp. 211-245; Apache Group, , http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/, (n.d.).

However, we currently lack support for designing variability-intensive service-oriented systems. Such systems could be used in different environments, without the need to design them from scratch. To support the design of variability-intensive service-oriented systems, reference architectures that facilitate variability in instantiated service-oriented architectures can help. Objective: The design of variability-intensive service-oriented reference architectures is subject to specific constraints. Architects need to know these constraints when designing such reference architectures. Our objective is to identify these constraints. Method: An exploratory case study was performed in the context of local e-government in the Netherlands to study constraints from the perspective of (a) the users of a variability-intensive service-oriented system (municipalities that implement national laws), and (b) the implementing organizations (software vendors). We collected data through interviews with representatives from five organizations, document analyses and expert meetings. Results: We identified ten constraints (e.g., organizational constraints, integration-related constraints) which affect the process of designing reference architectures for variability-intensive service-oriented systems. Also, we identified how stakeholders are affected by these constraints, and how constraints are specific to the case study domain. Conclusions: Our results help design variability-intensive service-oriented reference architectures. Furthermore, our results can be used to define processes to design such reference architectures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

These adaptations, when manually performed, normally become an onerous, error-prone activity. In this scenario, automated approaches have been proposed to support such adaptations; however, the development of SaS is not a trivial task. In parallel, reference architectures are reusable artifacts that aggregate the knowledge of architectures of software systems in specific domains. They have facilitated the development, standardization, and evolution of systems of those domains. In spite of their relevance, in the SaS domain, reference architectures that could support a more systematic development of SaS are not found yet. Considering this context, the main contribution of this paper is to present a reference architecture based on reflection for SaS, named RA4SaS (Reference Architecture for SaS). Its main purpose is to support the development of SaS that presents adaptations at runtime. To show the viability of this reference architecture, a case study is presented. As result, it has been observed that RA4SaS has presented good perspective to efficiently contribute to the area of SaS. © 2013 IEEE.",,"Automated approach; Error prones; Reference architecture; Runtimes; Self-adaptive software; Software systems; Computer software reusability",,,,,,"Maes, P., Concepts and experiments in computational reflection (1987) OOPSLA 1987, Ser.

The gap between Telecom and Web Worlds is becoming smaller and smaller. In this paper, we research on the integration of RTCWeb technology with IP multimedia subsystem. We introduce the development situation of RTCWeb technology and give the analysis of why we need the integration and the aim of the integration. We give solution on how to realize the integration from two points of view: protocol, network and route. Through added IMS-RTCWeb interworking gateway and the suitable protocols, we can construct the integration architecture. At the last, we list the problems on this integration topic and give the prospect of future work on this topic. © 2012 IEEE.","HTML5; IP Multimedia Subsystem; RTCWeb; SIP; WebSocket","HTML5; IP multimedia subsystems; RTCWeb; SIP; Websocket; Gateways (computer networks); Internet protocols; Network architecture; Signal processing; Telecommunication equipment; World Wide Web; Integration",,,,,,"(2011) WebRTC Architecture, , http://www.webrtc.org/reference/architecture, Google Inc.

It utilizes two concepts proposed by the authors: Augmented Cloud and Agent Platform as a Service (AgPaaS). Both concepts are discussed in the context of Cloud Computing as defined by NIST. The key idea of the presented solution is to span the cloud (i.e., computing infrastructure) beyond the data center borders by utilizing web browsers as computational workers. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by two prototypes: the first one was based on Java Applets and Adobe Flash, whereas the second one on Microsoft Silverlight. The prototypes were next used to perform simple experiments, mainly related to scalability issues. Selected results from the experiments are discussed in the final part of the paper.","Agent Platform as a Service; Augmented Cloud; Cloud Computing; Multi-Agent Systems",,,,,,,"Byrski, A., Kisiel-Dorohinicki, M., Carvalho, M., A crisis management approach to mission survivability in computational multiagent systems (2010) Comp.

It also describes current efforts to develop intelligent, adaptive, proactive, portable and affective multimodal interfaces. © 2012, IGI Global.",,,,,,,,"Ábalos, N., Espejo, G., López-Cózar, R., Callejas, Z., Griol, D., A multimodal dialogue system for an ambient intelligent application in home environments (2010) Proceedings of the 13th International Conference On Text, Speech and Dialogue, pp. 491-498. , In; Ábalos, N., Espejo, G., López-Cózar, R., Callejas, Z., Griol, D., A toolkit for the evaluation of spoken dialogue systems in ambient intelligence domains (2011) Proceedings of the Second International Workshop On Human-Centric Interfaces For Ambient Intelligence, , In, Nottingham, UK; Ai, H., Litman, D., Forbes-Riley, K., Rotaru, M., Tetreault, J., Purandare, A., Using systems and user performance features to improve emotion detection in spoken tutoring dialogs (2006) Proceedings of the International Conference On Spoken Language Processing, pp. 797-800. , In, Pittsburgh, PA; Bailly, G., Raidt, S., Elisei, F., Gaze, conversational agents and face-to-face communication (2010) Speech Communication, 52 (6), pp. 598-612. , doi:10.1016/j.specom.2010.02.015; Balci, K., XfaceEd: Authoring tool for embodied conversational agents (2005) Proceedings of the International Conference On Multimodal Interfaces, pp. 208-213. , In; Batliner, A., Hacker, C., Steidl, S., Nöth, E., D'Arcy, S., Russel, M., Wong, M., Towards multilingual speech recognition using data driven source/target acoustical units association (2004) Proceedings of the International Conference On Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, pp. 521-524. , In, Montreal, QC, Canada; Benesty, J., Sondhi, M.M., Huang, Y., (2008) Springer Handbook of Speech Processing, , New York, NY, Springer, doi:10.1007/978-3-540-49127-9; Beveridge, M., Fox, J., Automatic generation of spoken dialogue from medical plans and ontologies (2006) Biomedical Informatics, 39 (5), pp. 482-499. , doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2005.12.008; Bickmore, T., Giorgino, T., Some novel aspects of health communication from a dialogue systems perspective (2004) Proceedings of the AAAI Fall Symposium On Dialogue Systems For Health Communication, pp. 275-291. , In, Washington, DC; Bird, S., Klein, E., Loper, E., Baldridge, J., Multidisciplinary instruction with the Natural Language Toolkit (2008) Proceedings of the Third ACL Workshop On Issues In Teaching Computational Linguistics, pp. 62-70. , In; Boehner, K., Depaula, R., Dourish, P., Sengers, P., How emotion is made and measured (2007) International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 65 (4), pp. 275-291. , doi:10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.11.016; Bos, J., Klein, E., Oka, T., Meaningful conversation with a mobile robot (2003) Proceedings of the Tenth Conference On European Chapter of the Association For Computational Linguistics, pp. 71-74. , In; Burkhardt, F., van Ballegooy, M., Englert, R., Huber, R., An emotion-aware voice portal (2005) Proceedings of the Electronic Speech Signal Processing Conference, pp. 123-131. , In, Prague, Czech Republic; Callejas, Z., López-Cózar, R., Relations between de-facto criteria in the evaluation of a spoken dialogue system (2008) Speech Communication, 50 (8-9), pp. 646-665. , doi:10.1016/j. specom.2008.04.004; Callejas, Z., López-Cózar, R., Influence of contextual information in emotion annotation for spoken dialogue systems (2008) Speech Communication, 50 (5), pp. 416-433. , doi:10.1016/j. specom.2008.01.001; Camurri, A., Mazzarino, B., Volpe, G., Expressive interfaces (2004) Cognition Technology and Work, 6 (1), pp. 15-22. , doi:10.1007/s10111-003-0138-7; Cassell, J., Bickmore, T., Billinghurst, M., Campbell, L., Chang, K., Vilhálmsson, H., Yan, H., Embodiment in conversational interfaces: Rea (1999) Proceedings of the Conference On Computer-Human Interaction, pp. 520-527. , In; Cassell, J., Sullivan, J., Prevost, S., Churchill, E.F., (2000) Embodied Conversational Agents, , Cambridge, MA, MIT Press; Catizone, R., Setzer, A., Wilks, Y., Multimodal dialogue management in the COMIC Project (2003) Proceedings of the European Chapter of the Association For Computational Linguistics Workshop On Dialogue Systems: Interaction, Adaptation, and Styles of Management, pp. 25-34. , Budapest, Hungary; Chu, S.-W., O'Neill, I., Hanna, P., McTear, M., An approach to multistrategy dialogue management (2005) Proceedings of the Interspeech/ Eurospeech Conference, pp. 865-868. , In, Lisbon, Portugal; Clark, R., Richmond, K., King, S., Festival 2 - build your own general purpose unit selection speech synthesizer (2004) Proceedings of the 5th ISCA Workshop On Speech Synthesis, pp. 173-178. , In; Cole, R., Mariani, J., Uszkoreit, H., Varile, G.B., Zaenen, A., Zampolli, A., Zue, V., (1997) Survey of the State of the Art In Human Language Technology, , Cambridge, UK, Eds.).

The semantic web is a vision of information that is understandable by computers. This is what the Semantic Web is all about, describing things in a way that computers applications can understand it. Web browsers retrieve content and display it. Web browsing involves two tasks, finding the right web page and making sense of its content. So far much less attention has been paid to the interpretation of its content. In this paper we describe the tools which support the interpretation of web pages semantically without altering the original web page.

Such inconsistencies can result in cross-browser incompatibilities (XBIs) - situations in which the same web application can behave differently when run on different browsers. In some cases, XBIs consist of tolerable cosmetic differences. In other cases, however, they may completely prevent users from accessing part of a web application's functionality. Despite the prevalence of XBIs, there are hardly any tools that can help web developers detect and correct such issues. In fact, most existing approaches against XBIs involve a considerable amount of manual effort and are consequently extremely time consuming and error prone. In recent work, we have presented two complementary approaches, Web Diff and Cross T, for automatically detecting and reporting XBIs. In this paper, we present Cross Check, a more powerful and comprehensive technique and tool for XBI detection that combines and adapts these two approaches in a way that leverages their respective strengths. The paper also presents an empirical evaluation of Cross Check on a set of real-world web applications. The results of our experiments show that Cross Check is both effective and efficient in detecting XBIs, and that it can outperform existing techniques. © 2012 IEEE.","dynamic analysis; machine learning; web testing","Cross check; Empirical evaluations; Error prones; WEB application; Web developers; Web technologies; Web testing; Dynamic analysis; Learning systems; Software testing; World Wide Web; Web browsers",,,,,,"Garrett, J.J., (2005) Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications, , http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php, February; List of Web Browsers, , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_web_browsers; (2010) Browser Lab, , https://browserlab.adobe.com/, May; (2010) Expression Web, , http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/Web_Overview.aspx, May; Roy Choudhary, S., Versee, H., Orso, A., WebDiff: Automated identification of cross-browser issues in web applications (2010) Proceeding of the 2010 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance (ICSM), , IEEE, September; Mesbah, A., Prasad, M.R., Automated cross-browser compatibility testing (2011) ICSE '11, pp. 561-570. , Proceeding of the 33rd International Conference on Software Engineering, ser.

Several issues, however, hinder its wider adoption. One of them is the practical use of extra-functional properties (EFPs) that research community aims at integrating to component composition but for which industrial applications are still rare. When extra-functional properties are not considered or mis-interpreted, inconsistencies in application performance, security, reliability, etc. can result at run-time. As a possible solution we have proposed a general extra-functional properties system called EFFCC. In this paper we show how it can be applied to an industrial component model, namely the OSGi framework. This work analyses OSGi from the extra-functional properties viewpoint and shows how it can be enhanced by EFPs, expressed as OSGi capabilities. The proposed benefits of the presented approach are seamless integration of such properties into an existing framework and consistency of their interpretation among different vendors.

Attackers exploit vulnerabilities found in internals of web browsers or plugins to compromise the system and execute arbitrary code. In this paper, we present a filtering method which blocks malicious routines from being executed. Filtering is done by keeping a blacklist of dangerous routines and arguments separately to compare with the routines being called by the web browser at runtime. To show the concept, we built a prototype by using dynamic binary instrumentation framework called Pin. Pin provides rich API that allows us to build a custom tool that inserts instrumentation codes in the program. Using this tool, we are able to block malicious instructions from being executed. © 2012 GIRI.","Dynamic Binary Instrumentation; Sandbox; Security; Vulnerability; Web Browser","Custom tools; Dynamic binary instrumentation; Filtering method; Instrumentation code; Plug-ins; Runtimes; Sandbox; Security; Security problems; Vulnerability; Communication; Innovation; World Wide Web; Web browsers",,,,,,"Barth, A., Jackson, C., Reis, C., (2008) The Security Architecture of the Chromium Browser, , Google Chrome Team; Campos, A., Lane, B., Clark, N., Jassal, S., Hitchner, S., (2007) Conceptual Architecture off Irefox, , June; Min, J.W., Jung, S.M., Chung, T.M., (2011) Secure Interface Layer for Web Browsers, , CUTE; Devi, D., Pathak, D., Nandi, S., Vulnerabilities in Web Browsers, , Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India; (2011) Phishing and Malware Protection, , http://www.mozilla.orgien-US/firefoxiphishing-protectioni, [Online]; (2011) Microsoft Safety & Security Center, , http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/ie9.aspx, [Online]; (2008) The Chromium B10g [Online], , http://blog.chromium.orgl2008/11/understanding-phishing-andmalware.html; Grosskurth, A., Godfrey, M.W., A Reference Architecture for Web Browser, , s, Univ. of Waterloo; (2011) Browser Exploit, , http://en.wikipedia.orglwikilBrowser_exploit, [Online]; Song, C., Huang, Y., County, K., (2010) Detecting Method and Architecture Thereof for Malicious Codes, , US Patent 7, 665, 138 B2, Feb; (2011) Pintool-A Dynamic Binary Instrumentation Tool, , http://www.pintool.org, [Online]; Kiriansky, V., Bruening, D., Amarasinghe, S., Secure Execution Via Program Shepherding, , USENIX Security '02; Egele, M., Kirda, E., Kruegel, C., (2009) Mitigating Drive-by Download Attacks: Challenges and Open Problems, , INETSEC; (2011) Clickjacking, , http://en.wikipediaorglwiki/Clickjacking, [Online]; Polychronakis, M., Keromytis, A.D., (2011) ROP Payload Detection Using Speculative Code Execution, , MAL W ARE","Min, J.W.; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Sungkyunkwan Univ, 300 Cheoncheon-dong, Jangan-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea; email: jwmin@imtl.skku.ac.kr",,"National Information Society Agency (NIA);Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI);Korean Institute of Communication Sciences (KICS);IEEK Communication Society (IEEK ComSoc);Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE)",,"14th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology, ICACT 2012","19 February 2012 through 22 February 2012","PyeongChang",89559,17389445,9788955191639,,,"English","Int.

The generic nature of reference architectures leads to a less defined architecture design and application contexts, which makes the architecture goal definition and architecture design non-trivial steps, rooted in uncertainty. Objective: The paper presents a structured and comprehensive study on the congruence between context, goals, and design of software reference architectures. It proposes a tool for the design of congruent reference architectures and for the analysis of the level of congruence of existing reference architectures. Method: We define a framework for congruent reference architectures. The framework is based on state of the art results from literature and practice. We validate our framework and its quality as analytical tool by applying it for the analysis of 24 reference architectures. The conclusions from our analysis are compared to the opinions of experts on these reference architectures documented in literature and dedicated communication. Results: Our framework consists of a multi-dimensional classification space and of five types of reference architectures that are formed by combining specific values from the multi-dimensional classification space. Reference architectures that can be classified in one of these types have better chances to become a success. The validation of our framework confirms its quality as a tool for the analysis of the congruence of software reference architectures. Conclusion: This paper facilitates software architects and scientists in the inception, design, and application of congruent software reference architectures. The application of the tool improves the chance for success of a reference architecture. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It utilizes the concepts of Augmented Cloud and Agent Platform as a Service (AgPaaS), discussed in the context of Cloud Computing as defined by NIST. The key idea of the presented solution is to span the cloud (i.e. computing infrastructure) beyond the data center borders by utilizing volunteer nodes as computational workers. The feasibility of the approach was demonstrated by a prototype based on Java Applets and Adobe Flash technologies.

Though this ""data network isolated populations"" needs for telecom services in health and education is high, they do not have permanent access to a mobile data network nor have money to buy the most advanced end-devices.

In particular, reference architecture is a special type of architecture that captures the essence of software systems of a specific domain, achieving therefore well-recognized understanding of that domain. In spite of this, it is not observed concern in order to widely disseminate reference architectures and, as a consequence, the knowledge encompassed by these architectures. At the same time, Open Source Software (OSS) has been largely developed and used in both academy and industry. A diversity of OSS has been made available and has contributed to the software development through dissemination of knowledge that is encompassed mainly in the source code. Specifically, its success is due to OSS licences that have adequately supported its development and evolution. Thus, applying this same idea in order to disseminate reference architectures seems to be very interesting. The main contribution of this paper is to propose Open Source Reference Architecture (OSRA) that, based on principles of OSS, aims at promoting dissemination and evolution of reference architectures, intending to contribute to a more effective software development. © 2011 IEEE.","Open Source; Open source license; Reference Architecture","Open source license; Open Source Software; Open sources; Quality of softwares; Reference architecture; Software systems; Source codes; Architecture; Computer software; Software architecture; Software design; Open systems",,,,,,"Aberdour, M., Achieving quality in open-source software (2007) IEEE Software, 24 (1), pp. 58-64. , DOI 10.1109/MS.2007.2; Angelov, S., Grefen, P., Greefhorst, D., A classification of software reference architectures: Analyzing their success and effectiveness (2009) WICSA'2009, pp. 141-150. , Cambridge, UK; Arief, L.B., Gacek, C., Lawrie, T., Software architectures and open source software - Where can research leverage the most?

In particular, reference architectures have emerged, achieving well-recognized understanding of specific domains, promoting reuse of design expertise and facilitating the development of Systems. In another perspective, agile methodologies have been widely adopted as a promising iterative, incremental and collaborative software development process, including by the software industry. Considering the relevance of reference architectures, initiatives of agile methodologies exploring these architectures are also found. However, there is a lack of a panorama about the uses, impacts and perspectives of such architectures in the agile context. The main objective of this paper is present an detailed view about how reference architectures have been used in the context of agile methodologies. For this, we applied Systematic Review, a technique to systematically explore, organize, summarize, and assess all contributions of a specific research area. As main result, we have observed that reference architecture and agile methodology should be more investigated together. Furthermore, we intend to contribute to open perspectives of new and important research lines.",,"Agile contexts; Agile Methodologies; Collaborative software development; Reference architecture; Research areas; Software industry; Software systems; Systematic Review; Agile manufacturing systems; Groupware; Knowledge engineering; Software design; Software architecture",,,,,,"Kruchten, P., Obbink, H., Stafford, J., The past, present, and future for software architecture (2006) IEEE Software, 23 (2), pp. 22-30; Shaw, M., Clements, P., The golden age of software architecture (2006) IEEE Software, 23 (2), pp. 31-39. , Mar/Apr; Angclov, S., Trienckens, J.J., Grefen, P., Towards a mctliod for the evaluation of reference architectures: Experiences from a case (2008) ECSA'08, 240, p. 225. , Paphos, Cyprus; Eklund, U., Askerdal, O., Granholm, J., Alminger, A., Axelsson, J., Experience of introducing reference architectures in the developmenl of automotive electronie Systems (2005) SIGSOFT Softw.

One implementation of trusted computing technology standardised by the Trusted Computing Group is the trusted platform module (TPM). We build on the security provided by the TPM to create a trusted variant of identity management systems based on the popular OpenID protocol. We show that it is feasible to bind OpenID identities to the trustworthiness of the device. Our concept and implementation builds on previous work which showed that trusted computing can be used to create tickets. In this work, we use such tickets as a building block to establish trust in the OpenID protocol between the identity provider and the device. Furthermore, we investigate how mutual trust can be established in the communication between device and user during authentication. The concept of trust visualisation via a trusted environment and binding to user authentication are presented. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Authentication; Identity management; IdM; OpenID; TC; TPM; Trusted computing; Trusted platform module; Trusted token; Visual attestation",,,,,,,"Bal, G., Kuntze, N., Schmidt, A.U., Injecting trust to cryptographic key management (2009) 11th Intl.

This structural organization requires the interoperability of business processes (BPs)and information systems. Dealing with interoperability often leads to the deployment of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) based on Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) to design agile collaborative BPs and publish and compose new services. In order to protect each partner's own interests, security strategies must be developed and integrated in the service environment. Unfortunately, traditional security approaches deal with security concerns from a technical perspective (i.e., data transmission or authentication, etc.) and do not support end-to-end security in a distributed environment of business services and collaborative processes. In this paper, we attempt to improve end-to-end security by annotating service descriptions with security objectives used to generate convenient quality of protection (QoP) agreements between partners. Conversely, agreements are processed by a dedicated matching module with respect to security requirements and preferences to select business services, and then, compose their appropriate technical security services. © 2011 IEEE.","Computer security; data processing; distributed information system","Business organizations; Business Process; Business service; Collaborative business process; Collaborative process; Distributed environments; Distributed information systems; End-to-end security; Enterprise service bus; New services; Quality of protections; Security approach; Security objectives; Security requirements; Security strategies; Service description; Service environment; Service Oriented; Structural organization; Technical security; Virtual enterprise; Data processing; Information services; Information systems; Interoperability; Quality of service; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Supply chains; Virtual corporation; Security of data",,,,,,"Alam, M., Breu, R., Hafner, M., Modelling permissions in a (U/X)ML world (2006) Proc.

In another perspective, software architectures and reference architectures have played a significant role in determining the success of software systems. In this paper we present a reference architecture for SEEs, named RefASSET, which is based on concepts coming from the aspect-oriented approach. This architecture is specialized to the software testing domain and the development of tools for that domain is discussed. This and other case studies have pointed out that the use of aspects in RefASSET provides a better Separation of Concerns, resulting in reusable and evolvable SEEs. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Aspect orientation; Reference architecture; Software architecture; Software Engineering Environment; Software testing","Aspect orientation; Aspect-oriented; Evolvable; Reference architecture; Separation of concerns; Software engineering environments; Software production; Software systems; Computer software reusability; Computer software selection and evaluation; Software testing; Software architecture",,,,,,"Aldawud, O., Elrad, T., Bader, A., A UML profile for aspect oriented modeling (2003) 3rd Int.

A reference architecture ensures interoperability of systems through standardization. It also facilitates the instantiation of new concrete architectures. However, we currently lack procedures for systematically designing reference architectures that are empirically-grounded. Being empirically-grounded would increase the validity and reusability of a reference architecture. We therefore present an approach which helps systematically design reference architectures. Our approach consists of six steps performed by the software architect and domain experts. It helps design reference architectures either from scratch, or based on existing architecture artifacts. We also illustrate how our approach could be applied to the design of two existing reference architectures found in literature. © 2011 ACM.","design process; empirically-grounded; reference architecture; software architecture","Concrete architecture; Core elements; Design process; Domain experts; empirically-grounded; reference architecture; Software architects; Design; Interoperability; Reusability; Software architecture",,,,,,"Pohl, K., Boeckle, G., Van Der Linden, F., (2005) Software Product Line Engineering - Foundations, Principles, and Techniques, , Springer Verlag, Berlin / Heidelberg; Bass, L., Clements, P., Kazman, R., (2003) Software Architecture in Practice, , Addison-Wesley, Boston, MA; Eklund, U., Askerdal, O., Granholm, J., Alminger, A., Axelsson, J., Experience of Introducing Reference Architectures in the Development of Automotive Electronic Systems (2005) ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes, 30 (4), pp. 1-6; Karow, M., Pfeiffer, D., Raeckers, M., Empirical-based Construction of Reference Models in Public Administrations (2008) Proceedings of the Multikonferenz Wirtschaftsinformatik (Munich, Germany), pp. 1613-1624. , Gito-Verlag; Cloutier, R., Muller, G., Verma, D., Nilchiani, R., Hole, E., Bone, M., The Concept of Reference Architectures (2010) Systems Engineering, 13 (1), pp. 14-27; High, R., Kinder, S., Graham, S., (2005) IBM's SOA Foundation - An Architectural Introduction and Overview, , Technical Report.

This is a novel approach for information access based on users' context, that exploits social and collaborative models to overtake the limits of the existing solutions. Instead of relying on a pool of experts and on a rigid categorization, as it is usually done in the context-aware field, our solution allows the crowd of users to model, control, and manage the contextual knowledge through collaboration and participation. To have a dynamic and user-tailored context representation, and to enhance the process of retrieval based on users' actual situation, the community of users is encouraged to define the contexts of interest, to share, use, and discuss them, and to associate context to content and resources (Web pages, services, applications, etc.).

The paradigm is not limited to social networks and many enterprises are redesigning their business processes to create interactive systems in the form of mashups. However, protecting users' private data from unauthorized access in mashups is a challenging security problem. Existing solutions for addressing the various authorization problems are limited due to all-or-nothing policy, third party dependence and scalability issues. In this paper, we present a general permission delegation model for mashups that is fine-grained, user centric and scalable. This contribution has the following objectives: We formally specify the dependency relationships among multiple web applications. Dependency relationships are categorized on the basis of specific data items. We present an extensible reference architecture for configuring multiple web applications and a session management protocol. © 2011 Academic Journals.","Access control; Mashup; Permission delegation; Security",,,,,,,"Altinel, B., Cline, K., Louie, M., Ng, M.S., Singh, A., Damia: A data mashup fabric for intranet applications (2007) VLDB '07: Proceedings of the 33rd international conference on very large data bases, VLDB Endowment, pp. 1370-1373; (2006) Authentication for Web Applications-account Authentication Api, , http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/AuthForWebApps.html, AuthSub, Available at; Blaze, M., Feigenbaum, J., Keromytis, A., KeyNote: Trust management for public-key infrastructures (1999) Lecture Notes Comput.

In spite of the relevance of these issues, cross-browser testing of web applications is still a fairly immature field. Existing tools and techniques require a considerable manual effort to identify such issues and provide limited support to developers for fixing the underlying cause of the issues. To address these limitations, we propose a technique for automatically detecting cross-browser issues and assisting their diagnosis. Our approach is dynamic and is based on differential testing. It compares the behavior of a web application in different web browsers, identifies differences in behavior as potential issues, and reports them to the developers. Given a page to be analyzed, the comparison is performed by combining a structural analysis of the information in the page's DOM and a visual analysis of the page's appearance, obtained through screen captures. To evaluate the usefulness of our approach, we implemented our technique in a tool, called WEBDIFF, and used WEBDIFF to identify cross-browser issues in nine real web applications. The results of our evaluation are promising, in that WEBDIFF was able to automatically identify 121 issues in the applications, while generating only 21 false positives. Moreover, many of these false positives are due to limitations in the current implementation of WEBDIFF and could be eliminated with suitable engineering. © 2010 IEEE.",,"Automated identification; Cross-platform; Differential testing; False positive; Functional failure; Screen capture; Tools and techniques; Underlying cause; Visual analysis; WEB application; Web-based applications; Behavioral research; Computer software maintenance; Structural analysis; World Wide Web; Web browsers",,,,,,"(2010) Browser Statistics Month by Month, , http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsersstats.asp, May; (2010) Estate Agents Must Update Web Browser Compatibility Ahead of Microsoft Announcement, , http://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/article/default.aspx?objid=69332, March; (2010) Korea Sticking to Aging Browser, , http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2010/02/123_61463.html, February; (2010) Adobe, , https://browserlab.adobe.com/, May; (2010) Expression Web, , http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/WebOverview.aspx, May; Eaton, C., Memon, A.M., An empirical approach to evaluating web application compliance across diverse client platform configurations (2007) Int.

In another perspective, systematic mapping is a technique that provides an overview of a research area to assess the quantity of evidence existing on a topic of interest. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to introduce systematic mapping in order to explore, understand, organize and summarize software architecture knowledge, aiming at contributing to software architecture area. A simple example of use of this technique is presented and results point out to its viability also in the software architecture research area.

It describes the advance of many existing IT technologies and separates application and information resources from the underlying infrastructure. Personal Cloud is the hybrid deployment model that is combined private cloud and public cloud. By and large, cloud orchestration does not exist today. Current cloud service is provided by web browser or host installed application directly. According to the ITU-T draft, we might consider cloud orchestration environment in collaboration with other cloud providers. Previous work proposed security framework that has limitation of scalability for cloud orchestration. In this paper, we analyze security threats and requirements for previous researches and propose service model and security framework which include related technology for implementation and are possible to provide resource mobility. © 2010 IEEE.","Component; PCC; Personal Cloud Computing; Security framework; Threat","Component; PCC; Personal Cloud Computing; Security frameworks; Threat; Computer systems; Cloud computing",,,,,,"Brock, M., Goscinski, A., (2010) Toward A Framework for Cloud Security, Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing, 6082, pp. 254-263; (2007) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, , http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/; Top Threats to Cloud Computing, , http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/topthreats/csathreats.v1.0.pdf, V1.0; Security Guidance for Critical Areas of Focus in Cloud Computing, , http://www.cloudsecurityalliance.org/csaguide.pdf, V2.1; Rivera, J., Cloud Computing for Personal Use (2010) The Epoch Times; Mell, P., Grance, T., (2009) The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing, 10; (2010) Draft Deliverable on Functional Requirements and Reference Architecture, 9. , ITU-T Focus Group on Cloud Computing; (2010) Overview of Security Processes, 8. , Amazon Web Services; eXtensible Access Control Markup Language(XACML), , OASIS; Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP), , OASIS; Service Provisioning Markup Language(SPML), , OASIS; (2009) App Engine, , http://code.google.com/appengine/; (2009) Azure, , http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx; Chappell, D., (2009) Introducting the Azure Services Platform, White Paper, , David Chappell & Associates May; Goscinski, A., Resource Protection (1991) Distributed Operating Systems: The Logical Design, pp. 585-649. , Addison-Wesley, Reading; Yuan, E., Tong, J., Attributed based access control (ABAC) for Web services (2005) IEEE International Conference on Web Services, ICWS 2005, Proceedings, p. 569; Goscinski, A., Pieprzyk, J., Security in Distributed Operating Systems (1991) Datenschutz and Datensicherung, (5); Neuman, C.B., Ts'o, T., Kerberos: An authentication service for computer networks (1994) IEEE Communications Magazine, 32, pp. 33-38. , I.9","Na, S.-H.; Dept. of Computing Engineering, KyungHee University, 1 Seocheon-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, 446-701, South Korea; email: shna@icns.khu.ac.kr",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers;IEEE Computer Society;IEEE Comput.

The paradigm is not limited to social networks and many enterprises are redesigning their business processes to create interactive systems in the form of mashups. However, protecting users' private data from unauthorized access in mashups is a challenging security problem. Existing solutions for addressing the various authorization problems are limited due to all-or-nothing policy, third party dependence and scalability issues. In this paper, we present a general permission delegation model for mashups that is fine-grained, user centric and scalable. This contribution has the following objectives: We formally specify the dependency relationships among multiple web applications. Dependency relationships are categorized on the basis of specific data items. We present an extensible reference architecture for configuring multiple web applications and a session management protocol.SS © 2010 IEEE.","Access control; Mashup; Permission delegation; Security","Business Process; Data items; Dependency relationship; Interactive system; Interactive web applications; Mash-up; Mashups; Permission delegation; Private data; Reference architecture; Scalability issue; Security; Security problems; Session management; Social Networks; Third parties; User-centric; WEB application; Security systems; Web services; Access control",,,,,,"Merrill, D., Mashups: The new breed of Web app (2006) IBM Web Architecture Technical Library; What Is Web 2.0 - O'Reilly Media, , http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/ what-is-web-20.html, available at; Altinel, M., Brown, P., Cline, S., Kartha, R., Louie, E., Markl, V., Mau, L., Singh, A., Damia: A data mashup fabric for intranet applications (2007) VLDB '07: Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 1370-1373. , VLDB Endowment; Riabov, A.V., Boillet, E., Feblowitz, M.D., Liu, Z., Ranganathan, A., Wishful search: Interactive composition of data mashups (2008) WWW '08: Proceeding of the 17th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 775-784. , New York, NY, USA: ACM; Wong, J., Hong, J., Making mashups with marmite: Towards end-user programming for the web (2007) Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1435-1444. , ACM New York, NY, USA; Ennals, R., Garofalakis, M., MashMaker: Mashups for the masses (2007) Proceedings of the 2007 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1116-1118. , ACM New York, NY, USA; Jhingran, A., Enterprise information mashups: Integrating information, simply (2006) VLDB '06: Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, pp. 3-4. , VLDB Endowment; HousingMaps, , http://www.housingmaps.com, available at; Chicago Crime Data, , http://chicago.everyblock.com/crime/, available at; TweetDeck: A Simple and Fast Way to Experience Twitter, , http://www.tweetdeck.com, available at; Innovative Bill Pay, Personal Finance and Online Account Opening Tools, , http://www.yodlee.com, available at; Hasan, R., Winslett, M., Conlan, R., Slesinsky, B., Ramani, N., Please permit me: Stateless delegated authorization in mashups (2008) Computer Security Applications Conference, 2008.

To this end, new protocols design is needed to support new applications requirements and provide autonomy as well as intelligence to a network. In this paper, we first propose a new generic protocol model designed for the Future Internet. Our proposal is based on functionality composition concept, which allows the selection and composition of functionalities on demand in order to get the required and most suitable protocol for each application, each network and each device. One of the key distinguishing features of our framework is its flexibility and self-adaptability as well as neutral-technology implementation since it provides a high infrastructure and technology transparency. To highlight the benefits of our proposed model, we present a protocol implementation based on the service oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm. In addition, we present a service-oriented reference architecture for the Nth stratum framework defined within the 4WARD consortium. © 2010 IEEE.","Dynamic protocol selection; Future internet; Post-IP; Service composition; Service oriented architecture; Stratum","Future internet; Internet architecture; New applications; New protocol; On-Demand; Post-IP; Protocol implementation; Protocol model; Reference architecture; Research directions; Self-adaptability; Service composition; Service Oriented; Technology implementation; Information services; Internet; Network architecture; Quality of service; Research; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Technological forecasting; Internet protocols",,,,,,"(1981) RFC793 - Transmission Control Protocol, , September; (1980) RFC760 - Standard Internet Protocol, , January; (1980) RFC768 - User Datagram Protocol, , August; Johnsson, M., Andersen, F.-U., Huusko, J., Nguyen T.-M.-Trang, Franti, T., De Leon, M.P., Toward a new architectural framework - The Nth stratum concept (2008) MobiMedia'08, , Oulu, Finland, July; 4WARD - Architecture and Design for the Future Internet, , http://www.4wardproject.eu, FP7-4WARD project; Josuttis, N.M., (2007) SOA in Practice, , OReilly, ISBN-13: 978-0-596-52955-52960; Erl, T., (2008) SOA Principles of Service Design, , PRENTICE HALL, ISBN-13 9780132344821; Lang, T., Floreanial, D., (2001) Modular TCP Design and Its Applicatio in Performance Evaluation of Different TCP Versions for Wireless Environments, pp. 603-608. , ISBN: 0-7695-1177-5, ISCC 2001; Dutta, R., Rouskas, G.N., Baldine, I., Bragg, A., Stevenson, D., The SILO architecture for services integration, control, and optimization for the future internet Proc.

However, in many of those systems, the ontologies are hidden ""under the hood"". While a lot of useful applications of ontologies on the database and business logic layer have been proposed, the employment of ontologies in user interfaces has been gaining comparatively little attention so far. For providing a deeper understanding of that field as well as assisting developers of ontology-enhanced user interfaces, the authors give an overview of such applications and introduce a schema for characterizing the requirements of ontology-enhanced user interfaces. With this article, a state of the art survey of approaches is presented along with promising research directions. © 2010, IGI Global.","Ontologies; Ontology-Enhanced User Interfaces; Software Systems; User Interaction; User Interfaces","Business logic layers; Research directions; Software Systems; State of the art; User Interaction; Computer software; Surveys; User interfaces; Ontology",,,,,,"(2009) WAI-ARIA Overview, , http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria, W3C.

The main theme in this work is to use of the open source remote sensing (OSRS) software covering satellite image processing. Currently, OSRS software can be categorized into some types: full source codes, application programming interface (API) and development libraries. Furthermore, compared to proprietary remote sensing tools, some OSRS software provides highly advanced functions to fit specific target applications, as well as basic pre-processing or post-processing ones. However, till now, there are a few comparative and guidance studies to OSRS specialties. In this study, OSRS classification and its summary concerning features and especial specifications are presented in the consideration to land applications. Finally, geo-web architecture and system design with several OSRS software is shown in order to land applications to construct remote sensing contents and to provide interoperable web services in geo-web. It is thought that the application and implementation of OSRS software can widen uses-scope of remote sensing applications as IT main stream.","Design; Interface; Internet/web; Interoperability; Open systems; Software; Standards","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Computer software; Design; Image processing; Interfaces (materials); Interoperability; Open source software; Remote sensing; Satellite imagery; Social networking (online); Software as a service (SaaS); Standards; Web Design; Web services; Websites; World Wide Web; Advanced functions; Open source development; Remote sensing applications; Remote sensing tools; Satellite image processing; Structured information; Web based computing; Web implementation; Open systems",,,,,,"Benthall, S., An open source web GIS solution-the opengeo stack (2009) GEO Informatics, 12, pp. 40-43; Bruce, B., A survey of open source geospatial software (2007) MUUG Meeting; Hall, G.B., Leahy, M.G., (2008) Open Source Approaches in Spatial Data Handling, , Springer; Holmes, C., Towards an open geo web: Linking open source's 'architectures of participation' to the global SDI initiative (2007) The 9th Conference of Global Spatial Data Infrastructure; Maguire, D., (2006) GeoWeb 2.0: Implications for ESDI, , 12th EC-GIS&amp;GIS Workshop; Opticks url, http://opticks.orgOrfeo Toolbox url, http://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/otbOSSIM url, http://www.ossim.org/OSSIM/OSSIM_Home.htmlPark, Y.J., Lee, K., Mashup application for geospatial feature generation on web browser using google maps API (2008) Korean Journal of Remote Sensing, 24, pp. 389-396; Park, Y.J., Lee, K., Application of deegree of open source middleware to geo-portal implementation (2009) Korean Journal of Remote Sensing, 25 (4), pp. 367-374; Purvis, M.J., Sambells, Turner, C., (2006) Beginning Google Maps Applications with PHP and Ajax, , APRESS; Rose, L.C., (2004) Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture: A Community Guide to Implementing Standards-based Geospatial Portals, , OpenGIS Disscusion Paper; Scharl, A., Tochtermann, K., (2007) The Geospatial Web: How Geobrowers, Social Software and the Web 2.0 are Sharing the Network Society, , Springer; Sherman, G.E., (2008) Desktop GIS: Mapping the Planet with Open Source Tools, , Pragmatic Bookshelf; Steiniger, S., Bocher, E., An overview on current free and open source desktop GIS developments (2009) International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 23 (10), pp. 1345-1370; Torre, J., (2005) Report of existing GIS standards and software - Deliverable 3.6.1, p. 11p. , Core GIS 6.1, ices-SYNTHESYS NA-D 3.6 report","Lee, K.; Dept. of Information Systems Engineering, Hansung UniversitySouth Korea","Kajiwara K.Muramatsu K.Ono A.Soyama N.Endo T.Akatsuka S.","","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","ISPRS Technical Commission VIII Symposium on Networking the World with Remote Sensing","9 August 2010 through 12 August 2010",,111060,16821750,,,,"English","Int.

These are closely related and linked to each other, so as to design and implementation stages for a given target application to meet users' needs. In the mean time, many types of applications using some of them have been developed and implemented. The main theme in this study is a sort of hybrid-mashup. This term is distinguished from data-centric mashup, a typical mashup. As well, it focuses on open sources in geo-spatial communities, open APIs provided by web portal or commercial vendors, geo-standards in OGC and ISO and freely-accessed geo-based data. This can be regarded as technological bases towards more intelligent geo-web to fulfil more complex users' demands beyond data level. In this study, some cases are presented; for examples, mashup using Google maps API, smart 3D applications on mobile devices, or data interoperable application using middle ware of open sources. Architecture with layered structure for hybrid-mashup in geo-web is proposed with an example case. Open sources widely used in geo-spatial domain such as Geoserver or Deegree are utilized, and other open sources are also used in design process: PostgreSQL/PostGIS as open DBMS and spatial engine, and OpenLayers or Google maps API as client modules. The beneficial points of hybrid-mashup in the view from intelligent geo-web implementation are system adaptability and portability, and extensibility for user-sided application purposes. © 2010 ISPRS Archives.","Interface;

Especially, in the mashup theme using open API provided by general portal such as Google or Yahoo, web mapping application is the top-ranked one. However, web mapping, one component in geo-spatial web, has been the long-term task in the GIS communities, and web mapping components for registering, manipulating, retrieving, and publishing of scalable contents in the target-based application are also diversifying. Moreover, GIS standards are one of the crucial factors to web-based applications. The implementation of land monitoring portal, dealing with multiple sources and multiple types of data contents is the main task. Land monitoring requires the basic components for geo-spatial web portal with the functionalities as linking to other contents concerned, accessing to actual data sets, metadata crawling and harvesting, as well as spatial querying and web mapping. In this work, land monitoring architecture is designed with the basis of open source GIS programs and web mapping API, and Google maps API is used in client-side browser. In this client system, external data sets can be loaded and overlain on geo-based layer from Google mapping server. For server-side processing in this portal system, PostgreSQL and PostGIS are applied for database contents managed by system operators or providers, and Deegree is used for middleware to exchange OGC-GIS standard data formats or other formats what users want. While, in this system, this tier structure can be customized according to operation environments or land monitoring data structure: multi-client system and one middleware system or multi-client system, middleware, and server engine. The main advantages of this architecture are the cost-effectiveness due to free open source, the easiness of system optimization which can be fitted the performance requirement of a target system, and the modularization for light-weighted application implementation.","Deegree; Geo web; Geo-browser; Google maps API; Land monitoring portal; Postgis","Data contents; Data sets; Database contents; Deegree; Geo web; Geo-spatial; Google maps; Main tasks; Middleware system; Modularizations; Monitoring architecture; Multiple source; Open API; Open sources; Open-source GIS; Performance requirements; PostgreSQL; Server-side processing; Standard data format; System operator; System optimizations; Target systems; Technical architecture; Web mapping; Web portal; Web-based applications; Data communication systems; Data structures; Geographic information systems; Internet; Mapping; Metadata; Middleware; Modular construction; Monitoring; Portals; World Wide Web; Application programming interfaces (API)",,,,,,"Holmes, C., Towards an Open Geo Web: Linking Open Source's 'Architectures of Participation' to the Global SDI Initiative (2007) the 9th Conference of Global Spatial Data Infrastructure; Kalberer, P., Integrating Mashups and Open Source Web-GIS (2007) FOSS4G 2007 Conference; Lowe, J.W., Collaborate Semantic Geospatial Applications: Data Sources to Make Mashups Correct, Complete, Relevant and Revisited (2008), O'Reilly Where 2.0 ConferenceManso, M.A., Berabe, M.A., Gomez, R.P., Open Source Components to build A GeoPortal (2005) the 11th EC GI&GIS Workshop; Rose, L.C., (2004) Geospatial Portal Reference Architecture: A Community Guide to Implementing Standards-based Geospatial Portals, , OpenGIS Disscusion Paper, OGC 04-039; Pick, J.B., (2008) Geo-Business: GIS in the Digital Organization, , Wiley; Mitchell, T., (2005) Web Mapping Illustrated, , O'Reilly; ESRI Geospatial Portal Technology, , ESRI, An ESRI Whilte Paper, June 2007; Turner, A., Emerging Mass Market Geo Standards (2008) OGC Technical Committee Meeting, p. 2008; (2009) GeoWeb Vision - Technical Requirements, , Galdos System Inc; Fitzke, J., Greve, K., Muller, M., Poth, A., Building SDIs with Free Software - the deegree project (2004) 7th Conference of Global Spatial Data Infrastructure; Muller, M., deegree - Building Blocks for Spatial Data Infrastructure (2007) OSGeo Journal, pp. 1-3; Davis, S., (2007) GIS for Web Developers: Adding Where to Your Web Applications, Pragmatic Bookshelf; Purvis, M.J., Sambells, Turner, C., (2006) Beginning Google Maps Applications with PHP and Ajax, , APRESS; Sherman, G.E., (2008) Mapping the Planet with Open Source Tools, Pragmatic Bookshelf, , Desktop GIS; Hall, G.B., Leahy, M.G., (2008) Open Source Approaches in Spatial Data Handling, , Springer; Matthew, N., Stones, R., (2005) Beginning Databases with PostgreSQL from Novice to Professional, , Apress; Arnulf, C., Introduction to Spatial Data Management with Postgis (2006) Proc. of 2006 GeoWeb; Paul, R., Introduction to PostGIS (2007), FOSS4G2007 WorkshopsQuinn, T., Web Mapping with Virtual Earth and Oracle in EPA's Grant Tracking Systems (2008) Oracle Spatial User Conference, p. 2008; Park, Y.J., Lee, K., Mashup Application for Geo-spatial Feature Generation on Web Browser using Google Maps API, Korean (2008) Journal of Remote Sensing, 24, pp. 389-396; Benthall, S., An Open Source Web GIS Solution-The OpenGeo Stack (2009) GEO informatics, 12, pp. 40-43; Philippe, R., Michell, S., Agnes, V., (2002) Spatial Database with Application to GIS, , Elsevier Science","Lee, K.; Dept. of Information System Engineering, Hansung University, Seoul, South Korea; email: kilee@hansung.ac.kr",,"IEEE GRSS;NASA;NOAA;OGC",,"2009 17th International Conference on Geoinformatics, Geoinformatics 2009","12 August 2009 through 14 August 2009","Fairfax, VA",78555,,9781424445639,,,"English","Int.

Business organisations, crucially, need to make an accurate judgement regarding the suitability of web services prior to consumption. Pragmatics (in terms of illocutionary acts) and semiotics (the understanding of signs) and its own branch of pragmatics, connect at an important junction in relation to textual entities, providing a means to undertake a contextual discovery of web services. Furthermore, norms based upon shared beliefs and specifics relating to a business organisation, affect what a human agent may achieve during the web service discovery process. A preliminary web service discovery mechanism, using the theory behind semiotics, pragmatics, speech acts and deontic logic, is defined in this paper to aid human agents during the web service discovery process. The mechanism is designed to capture human intentions, communicated as speech acts, and delegate them to norm-based computational agents.",,"Information services; Information systems; Semiotics; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Societies and institutions; Websites; Business contexts; Business organisation; Computational agents; Deontic Logic; Human agent; Human intentions; Speech acts; Web service discovery; Web services",,,,,,"Atkinson, C., Bostan, P., Hummel, O., Stoll, D., A practical approach to web service discovery and retrieval (2007) IEEE International Conference on Web Services, , 9-13 July, Salt Lake City UT, USA.

This unfortunate reality limits the degree to which authentic user interactions with such systems can be collected and subsequently analyzed. We present the WAMI toolkit, which alleviates this difficulty by providing a framework for developing, deploying, and evaluating Web-Accessible Multimodal Interfaces in which users interact using speech, mouse, pen, and/or touch. The toolkit makes use of modern web-programming techniques, enabling the development of browser-based applications which rival the quality of traditional native interfaces, yet are available on a wide array of Internet-connected devices. We will showcase several sophisticated multimodal applications developed and deployed using the toolkit, which are available via desktop, laptop, and tablet PCs, as well as via several mobile devices. In addition, we will discuss resources provided by the toolkit for collecting, transcribing, and annotating usage data from multimodal user interactions. © 2008 ACM.","Dialogue system; Multimodal interface; Speech recognition; Voice over IP; World wide web","Graphical user interfaces; Interactive computer systems; Internet protocols; Internet telephony; Laptop computers; Mobile devices; Speech analysis; Speech processing; Voice/data communication systems; World Wide Web; Browser-based applications; Dialogue system; Input and outputs; Multi modals; Multimodal applications; Multimodal interface; Programming techniques; Tablet pcs; Usage datum; User interactions; Voice over IP; Speech recognition",,,,,,"Acero, A., Bernstein, N., Chambers, R., Jui, Y.C., Li, X., Odell, J., Nguyen, P., Zweig, G., Live search for mobile: Web services by voice on the cellphone (2008) Proc. of ICASSP; Aist, G., Allen, J., Campana, E., Gallo, C.G., Stoness, S., Swift, M., Tanenhaus, M.K., Incremental understanding in human-computer dialogue and experimental evidence for advantages over nonincremental methods (2007) Proc. of the 11th Workshop on the Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue, pp. 149-154. , R.

Its aim is to provide concise and good practice design guidelines on software components which will benefit practitioners, researchers, learners, and educators. It provides a summary of approaches, practices and authors own experiences on developing components for reuse, developing components for an application domain (domain analysis), and how to test them. The book is aimed at more illustrative examples with exercises, and a web site for instructor's course manual. Steven Covey (2006) says we now live in a Wisdom of Knowledge Age where people use the experiences gained from previous era. This is exactly true in software components where there are a number of books on CBSE and components based development with Java, C#, C++, and Ada. This edition collects all of the best practices that people can use in everyday life. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

RASIM allows the data model to evol ve independently from the software components and results in a robust implementation that remains viable as the domain changes. However, the development and management of data models in general are difficult and time consuming tasks involving the choice of a notation, the capture of the model, its validation for consistency, and the export of the model for implementation. Current limitations to this approach include the lack of ability to capture comprehensive domain knowledge, the loss of significant modeling information during implementation, the lack of model visualization and documentation capabilities, and exports being limited to one or two schema types. The advent of the Semantic Web and its demand for sophisticated data models has addressed this situation by providing a new level of data model management in the form of ontology tools. In this paper we describe the use of a representative ontology tool to capture and manage a data model for a space information system. The resulting ontology is implementation independent. Novel on-line visualization and documentation capabilities are available automatically, and the ability to export to various schemas can be added through tool plug-ins. In addition, the ingestion of data instances into the ontology allows validation of the ontology and results in a domain knowledge base. Semantic browsers are easily configured for the knowledge base. For example the export of the knowledge base to RDF/XML and RDFS/XML and the use of open source metadata browsers provide ready-made user interfaces that support both text- and facet-based search. This paper will present the Planetary Data System (PDS) data model as a case study and describe the import of the data model into an ontology tool. We will also describe the current effort to provide interoperability with the European Space Agency (ESA)/Planetary Science Archive (PSA) which is critically dependent on a common data model. © 2006 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Current limitation; Domain knowledge base; European Space Agency; Information management systems; Model visualization; Online visualizations; Reference architecture; Time-consuming tasks; Computer architecture; Information management; International trade; Knowledge based systems; Management information systems; Tools; User interfaces; Models",,,,,,"Crichton, D., Hughes, J.S., Hyon, J., Kelly, S., Science Search and Retrieval using XML (2000) Proceedings of the 2nd National Conference on Scientific and Technical Data, , National Academy of Science, Washington D.

In addition generic and reference architectures are compared to architectural styles based on their usage.

One of the key goals is to make this Core Grid Ontology general enough and easily extensible to be used by different Grid architectures or Grid middleware, so that the CGO can provide a common basis for representing Grid knowledge about Grid systems, including Grid resources, Grid middleware, services, applications, and Grid users. The Core Grid Ontology is designed and developed based on a general model of Grid infrastructures, and described in the Web Ontology Language OWL. Such an ontology can play an important role in building Grid-related Knowledge bases and in supporting the realization of the Semantic Grid. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Computer programming languages; Distributed computer systems; Information services; Knowledge based systems; Middleware; Semantics; Core Grid Ontology (CGO); Grid systems; Web Ontology Language; Information retrieval",,,,,,"http://grid.ucy.ac.cy/grisen/cgo.owl, CGO OWLhttp://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/Globus Toolkit, , http://www.globus.org/toolkit/; http://www.unicore.orgAlper, P., Corcho, O., Kotsiopoulos, I., Missier, P., Bechhofer, S., Kuo, D., Goble, C., S-OGSA as a reference architecture for OntoGrid and for the semantic grid (2006) The 3rd GGF Semantic Grid Workshop, GGF16; Brooke, J., Garwood, K., Goble, C., Semantic matching of grid resource descriptions (2004) Proceedings of Second European Across Grids Conference (AXGrids 2004), LNCS, 3165, pp. 240-249. , M.D.Dikaiakos, editor, Nicosia, Cyprus.

The present study developed an embedded web browser the add flash on flash plug in interface. The designs based on Mozilla and Konqueror reference architecture, since these applications constitute a good sample of current web browser technology and are quite distinct from others as they are all based on different rendering engines and GUI toolkits. During the development work flash support was enabled in the browser by adding functions, module and data types then modify some parts of the source code. After development the browser was tested several time and changes were made, final test performed and the browser supported flash player without any problem. Since flash objects are huge and the browser builds DOM and RENDER tree, it sacrifices its browsing speed. On the other hand new technologies are immerging into web page every day and web pages are updating from time to time. Facing these facts, the developed browser may meet some difficulties therefore the study expect, it not to display well some blocks in a web page. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Embedded system; Embedded web browser; Flash engine; Kenguka","Embedded web browsers; Flash engines; Kenguka; Computer architecture; Embedded systems; Flash memory; Information technology; Interfaces (computer); Problem solving; Web browsers",,,,,,"Feynman, (2005) MiniGUI Documents and Dev Packages, , http://www.minigui.com; Griffith, A., (2001) KDE 2/Qt Programming Bible, , IDG Books Worldwide, Inc; Hausmann, S., (2001) Konqueror/Embedded: An Open-source Web Browser for Embedded Linux System, , http://www.linuxjournal.com; Le Hors, A., Hégaret, P.L., Wood, L., Nicol, G., Robie, J., Champion, M., Byrne, S., (2004) Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification, , http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407A; Massa, A., Nine tips for improving embedded web browser design (2005) Comms Design, Com.; Shuyi, Z., Feynman, (2003) MiniGUI Documents and Dev Packages, , http://www.minigui.com; Stenback, J., Hegaret, P.L., Hors, A.L., (2003) Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 HTML Specificatio, , http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML","Kenguka, K.M.; Department of Electronics and Information Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 430074 Wuhan, Hubei, China",,,,,,,,18125638,,,,"English","Inf.

A unique feature of the platform is a data and applications integration framework that is employed for the integration of heterogeneous data, applications and processes across the entire laboratory production workflow. We also define a reference architecture for implementing similar solutions organized according to the laboratory data lifecycle phases. Each phase is modeled by a set of workflows integrating programs and databases in sequences of steps and associated communication and data transfers. We discuss the issues associated with each phase, and describe how these issues were approached in the proteomics implementation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",,"Computer architecture; Data flow analysis; Data structures; Data transfer; Database systems; Life cycle; Data management; Integration frameworks; Proteomics; Management information systems",,,,,,"Brazma, A., Hingamp, P., Minimum information about a microarray experiment (MIAME) - Toward standards for microarray data (2001) Nature Genetics, 29, pp. 365-371; Spellman, P., Miller, M., Design and implementation of microarray gene expression markup language (MAGE-ML) (2002) Genome Biology, 3 (9); Orchard, S., Hermjakob, H., Binz, P.A., Hoogland, C., Taylor, C.F., Zhu, W., Julian Jr., R.K., Apweiler, R., Further steps towards data standardisation: The proteomic standards initiative (2005) Proteomics, 5 (2), pp. 337-339; Goble, C., Wroe, C., Stevens, R., The myGrid project: Services, architecture and demonstrator (2003) Proc UK e-science Programme all Hands Conference, pp. 595-603; Leser, U., Naumann, F., (Almost) hands-off information integration for the life sciences (2005) CIDR; Etzold, T., Harris, H., Beaulah, S., SRS: An integration platform for databanks and analysis tools in bioinformatics (2003) Bioinformatics: Managing Scientific Data, , Edited by Z.

Although these environments manipulate the same kind of artifact (a document), they are not usually interoperable due to the implementation of different policies, protocols or infrastructure. Therefore, it is hard for users to use different collaborative systems to work on a single shared document and share several necessary information for the accomplishment of a collaborative authoring process that the involved tools offer separately. Towards such an interoperation, we propose the InterDOC (Environment for Supporting Interoperability of Collaborative Document Authoring Tools) reference architecture and environment. Using InterDOC, a group of authors can write a document in their favorite environment and can then make this document available via InterDOC to another group of authors using another environment, or even a single user application. We use OMG MDA in order to obtain platform-independent reference architecture.","Collaborative Authoring; Interoperability; Reference Architecture","Computer architecture; Computer supported cooperative work; Network protocols; Interoperability; User interfaces; Collaborative authoring; Reference architecture; Collaborative Authoring; Collaborative systems; Reference Architecture; Interoperability; Computer supported cooperative work",,,,,,"Steves, M., Morse, E., Looking at the whole picture: ""A case study of analyzing a virtual workplace"" (2001) IEEE International Workshop on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructures for Collaborative Enterprises, pp. 96-101. , 10th, 2001, Massachusetts.

Having a reference architecture available can aid both during maintenance and at design time: it can improve understanding of a given system, it can aid in analyzing trade-offs between different design options, and it can serve as a template for designing new systems and re-engineering existing ones. In this paper, we examine the history of the web browser domain and identify several underlying phenomena that have contributed to its evolution. We develop a reference architecture for web browsers based on two well known open source implementations, and we validate it against two additional implementations. Finally, we discuss our observations about this domain and its evolutionary history; in particular, we note that the significant reuse of open source components among different browsers and the emergence of extensive web standards have caused the browsers to exhibit ""convergent evolution."" © 2005 IEEE.","Component reuse; Reference architecture; Software architecture; Software evolution; Web browser","Components; Computer aided design; Computer software maintenance; Open systems; Web browsers; Component reuse; Reference architecture; Software architecture; Software evolution; Web browser; Computer architecture",,,,,,"QLDX Reverse Engineering Toolkit Home Page, , http://swag.uwaterloo.ca/qldx; Batory, D., Coglianese, L., Goodwin, M., Shafer, S., Creating reference architectures: An example from avionics (1995) Proceedings of the 1995 Symposium on Software Reusability (SSR '95), pp. 27-37; Clements, P., Northrop, L.M., (2001) Software Product Lines: Practices and Patterns, , Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc., Boston, MA, USA; Eixelsberger, W., Ogris, M., Gall, H., Bellay, B., Software architecture recovery of a program family (1998) Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE '98), pp. 508-511; Fischer, M., Pinzger, M., Gall, H., Analyzing and relating bug report data for feature tracking (2003) Proceedings of the 10th Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE '03), pp. 90-99; Futuyma, D.J., (1998) Evolutionary Biology, , Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA, USA, 3rd edition; Godfrey, M., Lee, E.H.S., Secrets from the monster: Extracting Mozilla's software architecture (2000) Second International Symposium on Constructing Software Engineering Tools (CoSET '00), , June; Hassan, A.E., Holt, R.C., A reference architecture for web servers (2000) Proceedings of 7th the Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE '00), pp. 150-160; Mockus, A., Fielding, R.T., Herbsleb, J., Two case studies of open source software development: Apache and Mozilla (2002) ACM Trans.

It extends the paradigm of dialogue system and web convergence from XML based service application abstractions to an extensible dialogue system platform infrastructure. The proposed approach separates the stateful dialogue interaction logic from the stateless interactions between the platform and the communication channels/resources. It provides a generic and layered XML abstraction that decouples the dialogue management and interaction management to support different dialogue XML based applications. It utilizes a 2-way web service proxy for dynamic service integration, binding and invocation. An automated agent based on the proposed approach is developed which supports multi-channel and multimodal services in enterprise environment.","Dialogue System; Multimodal; Web Services; XML","Automation; Communication channels (information theory); Computer architecture; Information analysis; Resource allocation; World Wide Web; Abstraction; Dialogue system; Multimodal; Web services; XML",,,,,,"W3C Voice Browser Activity, , http://www.w3.org/Voice/; W3C Multimodal Interaction Activity, , http://www.w3.org/2002/mmi/; W3C Web Service Activity, , http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/; Katsurada, K., A modality-independent MMI system architecture (2002) Proc. of the 7th ICSLP, pp. 2549-2552; Armaroli, C., An architecture for a multi-modal web browser (2002) Proc. of the 7th ICSLP, pp. 2253-2256; Meng, H., ISIS: A multi-modal, trilingual, distributed spoken dialog system developed with CORBA, Java, XML and KQML (2002) Proc. of the 7th ICSLP, pp. 2261-2564; Wang, K., Implementation of a multimodal dialogue system using extended markup languages (2002) Proc. of ICSLP'2000; Wang, K., Salt: A spoken language interface for web-based multimodal dialog systems (2002) Proc. of the 7th ICSLP, pp. 2241-2244; Seneff, S., GALAXY-II: A reference architecture for conversational system development (1998) Proc.

Because HTTP is a stateless protocol, two difficult problems emerge. First, managing transactions that require multiple client/server interactions, and second, developing a secure web-based information system without using cookies. The system satisfies the following constraints: 1) minimal programming effort for system maintenance; 2) using previously generated pages to prevent unauthorized use; 3) provide a uniform interface with identical traversal links in all pages to provide uninterrupted navigation capability under application control for all pages viewed by the user, and 4) provide user authentication. Web pages are divided into dynamic and static regions. The static region includes content common to all pages. Including links in this region allows a user to follow any traversal path without using the browser's ""BACK"" button, or the history list. In other words, all traversals are under the application's control. Because the application does not have to depend on the browser's capabilities, the application and the user can interact as co-routines. This paper illustrates novel application of techniques to develop web-based systems with minimal maintenance effort, and shows how context-free grammar and syntax- directed translation can be used to generate CGI programs.","CGI program generation; User authentication; Web-based information systems","Application-control; Maintenance efforts; Novel applications; Program generation; Stateless protocols; System maintenance; User authentication; Web based information systems; Application programs; Automatic programming; Computer applications; Computer systems programming; HTTP; Hypertext systems; Maintenance; Program translators; Websites; Authentication",,,,,,"Aho, A.V., Sethi, R., Ullman, J.D., (1986) Compilers Principles, Techniques, and Tools, , Addison Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts; Bellas, F., Fernandez, D., Muino, A., A flexible framework for engineering my portals (2004) WWW 2004, pp. 234-243. , May 17-22, New York; Branbrand, C., Moller, A.A., Schwartzbach, M.I., The bigwig project (2002) ACM Transactions on Internet Technology (TOIT), 2 (2), pp. 79-114. , May, ISBN: 1533-5399; Graunke, P.T., Krishnamurthi, S., Advanced control flows for flexible graphical user interfaces (2002) ICSE '02, pp. 277-287. , May 19-25, Orlando, Florida; Labrinidis, A., Roussopoulos, N., Generating dynamic content at database-backed web servers: CGI-BIN vs mod-perl (2000) SIGMOD Record, 29 (1), pp. 26-31. , March; Mittra, S., Thomas, Y.C.M., A flow-based approach to datagram security (1997) Proceedings of the ACM SIGCOMM '97 Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures, and Protocols for Computer Communication, 27 (4), pp. 221-234. , ISSN:0146-4833; Morrison, M., Morrison, J., Keys, A., Integrating web sites and databases (2002) Communications of the ACM, 45 (9), pp. 81-86. , September; Niinimaki, M., Tuisku, M., Heikkurinen, M., Design for flexibility - separating user interface design from program logic and data (2003) Proceedings of the 1st International Symposium on Information and Communication Technologies, pp. 475-480. , Dublin, Ireland; Park, J.S., Sandhu, R., Ahn, G., Role-based access control on the web (2001) ACM Transactions on Information Ans System Security, 4 (1), pp. 37-71. , February; Ploger, P.G., Wilberg, J., Langevin, M., Camposano, R., WWW based structuring of codesigns (1995) Proceedings of the 8th International Symposium on System Synthesis, pp. 1-6. , September, Cannes, France; Sandhu, R.S., Coyne, E.J., Feinstein, H.L., Youman, C.E., Role-based access control models (1996) IEEE Computer, 29 (2), pp. 38-44. , February; Zdun, U., Reengineering to the web: A reference architecture (2002) Proceedings of the 6th European Conference on Software Maintenance and Reengineering, pp. 164-173. , March 11-13","Department of Computer Science, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater OK 74078, United States",,"The International Society for Computers;and Their Applications (ISCA)",,"20th International Conference on Computers and Their Applications 2005, CATA 2005","16 March 2005 through 18 March 2005","New Orleans, LA",98927,,9781618395528,,,"English","Int.

A good understanding of the software system is needed to reduce the cost and length of this activity. Various approaches and tools have been proposed to assist in this process such as code browsers, slicing techniques, etc. These techniques neglect to use a central and vital piece of data available - the historical modification records stored in source control systems. These records offer a rich and detailed account of the evolution of the software system to its current state. In this paper, we present an approach which recovers valuable information from source control systems and attaches this information to the static dependency graph of a software system. We call this recovered information - Source Sticky Notes. We show how to use these notes along with the software reflexion framework to assist in understanding the architecture of large software systems. To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we apply it to understand the architecture of NetBSD - a large open source operating system.",,"Codes (symbols); Computer architecture; Computer software maintenance; Control systems; Data mining; Decision making; Information analysis; Knowledge acquisition; Program documentation; Code browsers; Software understanding; Source control systems; Computer aided software engineering",,,,,,"Baniassad, E.L., Murphy, G.C., Schwanninger, C., Design pattern rationale graphs: Linking design to source (2003) IEEE 25th International Conference on Software Engineering, , Portland, Oregon, USA, May; Bowman, I.T., Holt, R.C., Brewster, N.V., Linux as a case study: Its extracted software architecture (1999) IEEE 21st International Conference on Software Engineering, , Los Angeles, USA, May; Bratthall, L., Johansson, E., Regnell, B., Is a design rationale vital when predicting change impact? a controlled experiment on software architecture evolution (2000) Proceedings of the International Conference on Product Focused Software Process Improvement, , Oulu, Finland; Bruegge, B., Dutoit, A., (2000) Object-oriented Software Engineering, , Prentice Hall; Chen, A., Chou, E., Wong, J., Yao, A.Y., Zhang, Q., Zhang, S., Michail, A., CVSSearch: Searching through source code using CVS Comments (2001) IEEE International Conference Software Maintenance (ICSM2001), pp. 364-374. , Florence, Italy; Cubranic, D., Murphy, G.C., Hipikat: Recommending pertinent software development artifacts (2003) Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2000), pp. 408-419. , Portland, Oregon, May.

Many of these value added services focus on the higher data rates supported by 3G. An additional capability of 3G networks is the Multicall supplementary service, which enables the transmission of both voice and data simultaneously. This capability can be leveraged to provide a Multimodal user interface. In this paper, we propose a browser (thin) client reference architecture for supporting a conversational Multimodal application. We observe that such an architecture possesses several additional challenges when compared to a thick client application approach. We demonstrate the feasibility of our architecture with our prototype results, and devise a reference architecture for commercial implementations that enables users to interact with applications using simultaneous voice and data over 3G networks, without the restriction of software deployed to the device.",,"Error-prone interactions; Multimodal user interface; Natural language understanding (NLU); Thin client multimodal applications; Computer applications; Computer networks; Computer programming languages; Computer software; Data communication equipment; Data processing; Graphical user interfaces; User interfaces; Computer architecture",,,,,,"Ruuska, P., Frantti, T., The multicall service to support multimedia services in the UMTS networks (2001) 27 th Euromicro Conference 2001: A Net Odyssey (euromicro'01), , Warsaw, Poland, September; Donovan, R.E., Franz, M., Sorensen, J.S., Roukos, S., Phrase splicing and variable substitution using the IBM trainable speech synthesis system (1999) Proc.

One may argue that the most reliable resource of information is the system's source code. Nevertheless a significant knowledge about the problem domain is required in order to facilitate the extraction of the system's useful architectural information. In this approach feature modeling is introduced as an additional step in a system's architectural recovery process. Feature modeling structures the system's functionality and supports reverse engineering by detecting the relations between source code elements and requirements. Tracing these relations may lead to a better understanding of the program's behavior and the recovery of various architectural elements. In this way, by providing a mapping between source code and features, the system's feature model supports program comprehension and architectural recovery. The approach is developed as first part of a migration methodology towards a component-based architecture of legacy systems. Recovered information about features and architecture is collected in a repository to enable a refactoring as next step. The approach is currently applied in a large project for reengineering of an industrial Image Processing System.",,"Feature modeling; Legacy software systems; Software architecture recovery; Software technology; Codes (symbols); Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Decision theory; Image processing; Interfaces (computer); Reverse engineering; Software engineering; Legacy systems",,,,,,"AmiEddi 1.3 - Feature Model Editing Tool, , http://www.generative-programming.org, [AmiEddi]; Bengtsson, P., Bosch, J., Scenario-based software architecture reengineering (1998) Proc. 5th International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR5), pp. 308-317. , [Bengtsson et al. 1998], IEEE Computer Society Press, Victoria, B.C, Canada, June; Boger, M., Fragemann, P., Storm, T., Refactoring browser for UML (2002) Proceedings Netobjectdays 2002, , http://www.netobjectdays.org/pdf/02/papers/node/0376.pdf, [Boger et al. 2002] Unland, R. et al., Erfurt, October 6-10, 2002.

These activities are performed at many distributed sites. In order to effectively integrate these distributed sites, this work adopts distributed object and mobile object technologies, Rosetta Net implementation framework, as well as holon and holarchy concepts derived from studying social organizations and living organizms to develop a holonic information coordination system (HICS). The generic holon is first developed by adopting the technologies of the distributed object-oriented approach with common object request broker architecture infrastructure, n-tier client/server architecture, a knowledge base, and data warehousing to achieve the properties of holon, error recovery, and security certification. The communication holon (CH) is then generated by inheriting the generic holon. Finally, CHs are employed to establish HICS. The CH exhibits basic holonic attributes, such as intelligence, autonomy, and cooperation. Furthermore, the CH can handle partner interface processes, and data exchange by various data formats following the standards of RosettaNet business messages. The failure recovery mechanism of the CH causes HICS to be more reliable than legacy systems. As such, HICS can meet the future requirements of supply-chain information integration of virtual enterprises. Note to Practitioners-An HICS that handles the information flow of the supply chain is proposed in this work. HICS is composed of many communication holons (CHs). Any company that would like to use HICS to exchange information for enterprise integration may possess a CH. The CH is implemented with the Java web-start technology. Therefore, any company can download a CH from the web server via a web browser. The company is, then, able to communicate with other members throughout the supply chain. Accordingly, CHs are scattered throughout the Internet/intranet and each CH can act as both an information supplier and an information consumer. Further, because the CH adopts the RoesettaNet implementation framework (RNIF), any company that has the capability of RNIF can also communicate with the members in the HICS framework via RosettaNet business messages.","Communication holon (CH); Holonic information coordination systems (HICSs); Holonic manufacturing systems (HMSs); Supply-chain information systems (SCISs)","Automation; Computer programming languages; Management information systems; Mathematical models; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network protocols; World Wide Web; Communication holon (CH); Holonic information systems (HIC); Holonic manufacturing systems (HMS); Supply-chain information systems (SCIS); Agile manufacturing systems",,,,,,"Melan, E.H., (1993) Process Management, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Slater, R.H., (1991) Integrated Process Management: A Quality Model, , New York: McGraw-Hill; Chen, Y.-M., Liao, C.-C., Prasad, B., A systematic application of virtual enterprising through knowledge management techniques (1998) J.

The Web has been the ""Big Thing"" during the past 10 years, but its success has also made it very difficult to find the appropriate information in an ocean of over 3 billion pages. Whereas search engines achieve incredible precision, they suffer from the same ""one size fits all"" approach that characterizes the Web sites they index. The paper defends the position that personalization, and in particular automatic personalization or adaptation, is the key to reach the goal of offering each individual user (or user group) the information they need. During the panel discussion there was debate about whether the user should always have access and control over the entire (hypertextual) information space. There were different views on whether the ""right"" to all the information is best guaranteed by offering tools that reduce the information space the user perceives so that the user can actually find and reach the information, or by offering unfiltered access to an ocean of information in which everything is available but in which perhaps nothing can be found. We argue in favor of adaptation but at the same time point out flaws in the way adaptive hypermedia has been used until now. The paper then proposes a new, modular adaptive hypermedia architecture that should lead to adaptive Web-based systems as the ""Next Big Thing"" indeed. In this architecture, different applications can collaborate in creating and updating a user model. Shared user model servers are not just needed for adaptive Web sites, but are also the key to enabling the development of ambient intelligence. (Many small systems then need to work together and base their actions on common knowledge about their user(s).) Sharing user models can of course cause a ""big brother"" problem. Legislation is already in place to protect users' privacy by placing legal limits on the kind of user modeling and sharing of user models that is allowed. The paper briefly reviews the legal issues of user modeling and adaptation in order to provide not just a future outlook based on ""wild imagination"" but based on a realistic vision of what will not only become technically possible but also of what will be ""acceptable"".",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer architecture; Computer vision; Hypermedia systems; Hypertext systems; Information analysis; Laws and legislation; World Wide Web; Modular adaptive hypermedia architecture; Modular systems; Personalization; Adaptive systems",,,,,,"Anderson, J.R., (2000) Cognitive Psychology and Its Implications, Fifth Edition, p. 241. , Worth Publishers: NY; Carr, L., Bechhofer, S., Goble, C., Hall, W., Conceptual linking: Ontology-based open hypermedia (2001) Tenth International World Wide Web Conference, , http://www10.org/cdrom/papers/246/, Hong Kong, May; Brusilovsky, P., Adaptive hypermedia (2001) User Modeling and User Adapted Interaction, 11 (1-2), pp. 87-110. , http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~peterb/papers/brusilovsky-umuai-2001.pdf, Ten Year Anniversary Issue; Brusilovsky, P., Eklund, J., Schwarz, E., Web-based education for all: A tool for developing adaptive courseware (1998) Proceedings of 7th International World Wide Web Conference, , http://www7.scu.edu.au/programme/fullpapers/1893/com1893.htm, Brisbane, April; Chepegin, V., Aroyo, L., De Bra, P., Houben, G., CHIME: Service-oriented framework for adaptive web-based systems (2003) Conferentie Informatiewetenschap, pp. 29-36. , http://wwwis.win.tue.nl/infwet03/proceedings/3/, Eindhoven, November; De Bra, P., Aerts, A., Berden, B., De Lange, B., Rousseau, B., Santic, T., Smits, D., Stash, N., AHA!

The wrapper is designed to satisfy service stability, data integration, and application integration requirements, and exploits State Chart Diagrams and open standard technologies, such as XML and XSL.

Developed under tight schedules, with high employee turn over, and in rapidly evolving environment, these systems are often poorly structured and poorly documented. Maintaining such systems is problematic. This paper presents an approach to recover the architecture of such systems, in order to make maintenance more manageable. Our lightweight approach is flexible and retargetable to the various technologies that are used in developing web applications. The approach extracts the structure of dynamic web applications and shows the interaction between their various components such as databases, distributed objects, and web pages. The recovery process uses a set of specialized extractors to analyze the source code and binaries of web applications. The extracted data is manipulated to reduce the complexity of the architectural diagrams. Developers can use the extracted architecture to gain a better understanding of web applications and to assist in their maintenance.",,"Computational complexity; Computer architecture; Database systems; Distributed computer systems; HTML; Java programming language; Multimedia systems; Servers; Web browsers; World Wide Web; Architecture recovery; Distributed objects; Web applications; Web servers; Computer software",,,,,,"Antoniol, G., Canfora, G., Casazza, G., Lucia, A.D., Web site reengineering using RMM Proceedings of euroREF: 7th Reengineering Forum, Zurich, Switzerland, Mar. 2000; Boldyreff, C., (2000) Web Evolution: Theory and Practice, , http://www.dur.ac.uk/cornelia.boldyreff/lect-1.ppt; Bowman, I.T., Architecture recovery for object oriented systems (1999), Master's thesis, University of WaterlooBowman, I.T., Holt, R.C., Brewster, N.V., Linux as a case study: Its extracted software architecture IEEE 21st International Conference on Software Engineering, Los Angeles, USA, May 1999; Brereton, P., Budgen, D., Hamilton, G., Hypertext: The next maintenance mountain (1998) Computer, 31 (12), pp. 49-55. , Dec; Ceri, S., Fraternali, P., Bongio, A., Web modeling language (WebML): A modeling language for designing web sites The Ninth International World Wide Web Conference (WWW9), Amsterdam, Netherlands, May 2000, , http://www9.org/w9cdrom/177/177.html; Chaudhuri, S., Dayal, U., An overview of data warehousing and OLAP technology (1997) ACM SIGMOD Record, 26 (1). , Mar; Clarke, G., Barnard, D.T., Error handling in a parallel LR substring parser (1993) Computer Languages, 19 (4), pp. 247-259; Conallen, J., (1999) Building Web Applications with UML, , object technology.

Many software product line efforts risk failure by ignoring non-reuse aspects of software product lines. One should also consider how to increase the perceived value of each product in the line compared to competitors. Product characterization refers to the analysis of existing and potential products of a firm and their comparison with existing and potential products in the market place. The results of product characterization are essential for defining appropriate goals for a software product line. Holmes is a software product line support tool that addresses the full software product line life cycle by supporting all phases of the Sherlock method.

These systems exhibit full content management of a, possibly distributed, multimedia information archive and provide for the integration of internal with external workflows. They are built to serve as open communications platform for a web-wide audience that is also involved in building, modifying, and restructuring the contents provided. All changes to the information archive have to be executed and reflected to the audience within on-line compatible time-limits. Based on an actual project, the MPDB project at FSU, we derive a reference architecture for this family of systems and refine it into a concrete application design. We present our solution to the DBMS management problem, inherent to this system type, and motivate the use of the components library that was developed for this task. A short look at technological alternatives to implement the architecture in a concrete system completes our presentation. Throughout the paper we refer to the now released MPDB system to explain our motivation and choices. We strive for an immediately applicable and pragmatic solution that is, nevertheless, based on a clean architecture and reusable concepts.",,"C (programming language); Client server computer systems; Computational complexity; Data communication systems; Database systems; HTTP; Information retrieval systems; Multimedia systems; Program compilers; User interfaces; Web browsers; World Wide Web; Component driven architecture; Directly reactive information system; Domain specific software system; Computer aided software engineering",,,,,,,"Stolle, Rene; Friedrich Schiller Universiaet Jena, Jena, Germany",,"IEEE Computer Society","IEEE, Piscataway, NJ, United States","7th IEEE International Conference and Workshop on the Engineering of Computer Based Systems (ECBS 2000)","3 April 2000 through 7 April 2000","Edinburgh, UK",56661,,,85RRA,,"English","Proc Int Symp Workshop Eng Computer Based Syst",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033903344

A single technology exploiting a semantic model of the hospital universe provides users with information and data of diverse origins, generated by the various actors or departments of the health organization. Functions provided include act management and patient record management governed by domain semantics. The functionality has been validated through laboratory experiments against the requirements of protocol directed care and health networks. The functionality is integrated into a clinician workstation exploited in the Internet/Intranet environment thanks to a commercial browser. These results have been obtained with the support of several projects in the frame of the Health-Care Telematics Applications Programme of the European Community and of the Eureka Programme.","Act management; Electronic patient record; Health networks; Semantic modelling","article; hospital; information system; medical information; model; semantics; technology; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Protocols; Database Management Systems; Europe; Humans; Internet; Local Area Networks; Medical Record Linkage; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; Practice Guidelines",,,,,,"Riley, R.T., Organizational issues in health informatics: The challenge we face (1995) Proceedings of MEDINFO'95, pp. 1570-1574. , R.

NSA’s MISSI (Multilevel Information System Security Initiative) security reference architecture is used as an illustrative example. We demonstrate that an ADL should have not only the capability to specify interfaces, connections and operational constraints, but also to specify how it is related (or conforms) with other architectures or to implementations. A reference architecture such as MISSI is defined in Rapide [14] as a set of hierarchical interface connection architectures [17]. Each Rapide interface connection architecture serves as a reference architecture-an abstract architecture that allows a number of different implementations, but which enforces a common structure and communication rules.

Centre for IT Research, Aarhus University, Denmark","Open hypermedia technology is currently showing its potential for building hypermedia authoring and browsing environments encompassing existing, widely used applications such as Microsoft Word on Windows platforms and Emacs on Unix platforms. The ultimate goal is to introduce hypermedia technology into as many applications and components of existing computing environments as possible to evolve gradually current computing environments into a world-wide, unified hypermedia environment spanning multiple computing platforms. A significant step towards this rewarding and ambitious goal is to introduce open hypermedia standards that allow interoperability between the many small hypermedia environments that make up the global hypermedia environment. The contributions of this special issue address the concerns of application developers who design applications and system developers who design hypermedia environments. The issue presents a snapshot of the ongoing effort in the open hypermedia community to define common guidelines and standards for interoperation between open hypermedia environments.",,"Codes (standards); Computer architecture; Data storage equipment; Digital libraries; Interfaces (computer); Interoperability; Open systems; Software engineering; UNIX; Emacs Platform; Microsoft Word; Open hypermedia systems (OHS); Hypermedia systems",,,,,,"Anderson, K.M., A Critique of the Open Hypermedia Protocol, pp. 11-17. , http://www.daimi.aau.dk/~kock/OHS-HT97/Papers/anderson.html, In [21]; Aßfalg, R., (1994) Proceedings of the Workshop on Open Hypertext Systems, , Konstanz, Germany, May; Bapat, A., Propagating Navigation, pp. 24-25. , http://www.daimi.aau.dk/~kock/OHS-HT97/Papers/bapat.txt, In [21]; Barman, D., ACM Hypertext '96 Conference, , http://www.cs.unc.edu/~barman/HT96/; Berners-Lee, T., Cailliau, R., Luotonen, A., Nielsen, H.F., Secret, A., (1994) The World-Wide Web.

In this paper, we describe an experimental implementation of a cooperative information system, built on web browser interfaces, the Oracle database manager, and CGI scripts. This initial implementation demonstrates the practical feasibility of building DIOM-based customizable and scalable solutions for interconnecting information consumers with information producers. Highlights of this simple system include: (1) a demonstration of the DIOM query mediation component with interactive query tracing, (2) a generic wrapper construction library, and (3) a demo accessible over the Internet. © 1997 ACM.",,"Interoperability; Query processing; Autonomous data sources; Co-operative information system; Heterogeneous information; Interactive queries; Oracle database; Query mediations; Scalable solution; Web browser interface; Information systems",,,,,,"Bowman, C., Danzig, P., Hardy, D., Manber, U., Schwartz, M.F., The Harvest information discovery and access system (1994) Proceedings of the Second International World Wide Web Conference, pp. 763-771. , Chicago, Illinois, October; Hull, R., King, R., (1995) Reference Architecture for the Intelligent Integration of Information, , http://isse.gmu.edu/I3-Arch/index.html, version 1.0.1, May; Lee, Y., Rainbow: A Prototype of the Diom Interoperable System, , http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/diom, MSc.
